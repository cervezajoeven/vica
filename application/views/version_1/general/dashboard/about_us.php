				<p style="text-align: justify;">St. Thérèse Private School (STePS) started in 1980 with just 20 pre-school enrollees and operating with only a handful of teachers and non-teaching personnel, in a 300 square-foot property in Kasipagan Street in Mandaluyong City. 

					The number of enrollees increased over the years which necessitated renovations and extensions of the school. 

					In 2002, Mrs. Thelma C. Go, the owner and directress of the school, took a big leap by adding grade school, initially Grades 1-4, to its growing pre-school family.

					A 3-storey concrete annex, located a few steps from the main building was built. The annex housed air-conditioned classrooms (as with every other classroom in the main building) and a multi-function room on the 3rd floor.

					The Pre-school Department building which was then located in Payapa cor. Tiyaga Streets, was adjacent to the main Grade School building.

					From St. Therese Children’s Center, the school’s name was changed to St. Therese Educational Private School of Mandaluyong, Inc. (as registered in the Securities and Exchange Commission) in 2002.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">
					Because of the increasing number of enrollees in the grade school, a Grade School Extension was built along Kasipagan cor. Tiyaga Streets. This extension housed Grades 3, 4, and 5. Grades 1 and 2 were still in the main building.

					In 2004, a brand new building was built along Kasipagan Street. This was made into the Grade School main building which housed Grades 1, 4, 5, and 6.  This new building had air-conditioned classrooms, Computer Lab., Science Lab., Speech Lab., and HELE room. Grades 2 and 3 were still in the grade school extension.

					In 2007, a four-storey (with a provision for a fifth floor) building along Bumatay Street was built. It became the new house for the Grade School Department. The Pre-school department took over the building in Kasipagan which was vacated by the Grade School Department.

					The grade school extension in Tiyaga was given up.

					In 2008, the school’s name was changed from St. Therese Educational Private School to St. Thérèse Private School.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">
					The number of enrollees, which continuously grew, building an extension and expansion in Bumatay St. was inevitable. This expansion was completed in 2011.

					Because of Mrs. Go’s commitment to her pupils and the school’s entire community to give them only the best, another building construction/extension was seen in the first quarter of 2015. This time a gymnasium/sports facility was constructed with an auditorium which is set to be finished soon. Also with the 1,500 square meter quadrangle which also serves as a safe evacuation area during emergencies, the school aligns these facilities with the requirements of the K-12 program of the Department of Education, to produce not only functioning literate graduates, but graduates who have been developed holistically.

					As the number of pupils grew from mere 20 enrollees to a yearly average of 1,500, the school continues and will continue to innovate and adapt to the many changes in the educational system to give the best possible education to its pupils.
