They were going back and forth inside the tent where the circus was. Floro and I were  amazed looking at the beautiful things around us. As we passed by the entrance gate, we saw a big  brown dog. We wanted to touch its curly fur but suddenly we couldn’t find it in its little house. “He was  lost” said Floro. We wanted to play with it, but it was time for the circus to begin. Floro and I ran into  the tent. “We forgot the big brown nice dog”, I said. “Thank you boys” said the man. “The big brown  and nice dog is not lost. You will see.” The man was smiling.","We had a big surprise. The circus started. We saw a big brown and nice dog with curly fur. It was in the show. Floro and I were invited by the man to join him in the show and we tried to touch the big brown nice dog with our hands and we took turns to carry it.        We were not afraid of it but rather we appreciated the beauty of that nice dog. It reminded us to think about God’s creation and all the beautiful things around us.        Some of us live in rural areas with good friends. Few of us had experienced going to the circus during fiesta or going to the zoo where we see many kinds of animals. Other people had gone to the park where they enjoyed having picnic with their families. They recognized the presence of God by looking at the beautiful living things around.  - Tell something about the experience of Floro and Berto in the circus. - What attracted Floro  and  Berto when they entered the gate?Why? -       What surprise them when the show started? -       How did they feel when they were allowed to  touch the big brown nice dog? -What were their realizations after that beautiful experience? - Do  you have the same experience with Floro and Berto where you enjoyed       the beauty of nature and God’s creation when you travel?","","","–             God reveals Himself as All – Powerful and All beauty  Beautiful. We become aware of His power and one     by seeing the things around us. He is the only can     who can do such great work. No one among us         make such a perfect living creature.        God wanted us to share His happiness. He thought of giving us this great and beautiful world to live in. There is something we ought to do when we see these beautiful places, animals, plants, and flowers. Only God can make things out of nothing. He showed His power by making mountains, waterfalls, rivers, sky, rainbow, and also lightning. God’s power and His beauty are shown to us. When we hear the rumbling of the thunder, we don’t need to be afraid. God is with us. But sometimes, we are frightened by the storms, the wind, and the heavy rain because God’s power is over us.        When we look at all the beautiful things that God has made, we are learning something about Him and we can say that He is powerful, He is great and is beautiful.  God wants us to be happy to see His living presence in everything He has made for us.      The first way God reveals Himself to us is through creation. “The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament proclaims His handiwork” (Ps. 19:1). In creation, man holds a special place. God even gives us a share in His own creativity. “Be fertile and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it.” (Gn. 1:28) “God’s eternal power and divinity have become visible, recognized through the things He has made” (Rom. 1:20)                                                                                                CFC 65","God loves us through what we see             around us, He is present, and is with us. We             depend on His Divine Providence. His love for  us is      greater than it is for stones, plants or animals,  and        many beautiful places where we can enjoy  His presence. Even when we close our eyes we can still think of God and we can say that God has  power. Everything that He created has beauty and He reveals Himself to us through His wonderful  creation.  A. Try to remember and write your answer below each question.                                                                            1 Why did God make all things for us?                                                                             2 Why do all things tell us about God?  3 What makes us special over other created things?  4 What particular action would you like to do to preserve things for the next generation? B. Recall and write in your journal notebook your experiences when you feel the living presence of        God.  God creates all things and keeps them existing. His loving care for his creation is called Divine Providence.","God gives us power over all creation so that we can use and enjoy it, care for it, develop it, and preserve it for the next generation. To exercise this power, God gives us intelligence, free will, and senses. To us alone is given the power to know, to serve, and love God.

To pray to increase God                                                                      our faith and trust in  a Promise        It was one cold   morning when Angelie heard the loud voice    of her mother calling her name. “Are you      not going to wake up?I can’t cook for you      because I’m busy with other chores,” said     the mother.        Angelie was irritated by her mother’s tone of voice but she answered her calmly: “But mama, we do not have anything to cook. What will I cook then?” Angelie asked her mother. “Then take your initiative to look for something that you can cook.” The mother replied. Angelie quickly made her way to their crop field and in haste looked for root crops that she could get to bring home. She was lucky to find just enough cassava and she brought them home. She cooked them and her mother was happy at last when they had something to eat.","Looking back at their life time, Angelie could still ask why they always have scarcity of food, but she knows and understands that they are poor, they are eight in the family and her parents do not have stable source of income. In spite of this, she did not regret to be born from a poor family because even if they don’t have everything they need, she feels contented and continues to dream bigger things.        One day, Angelie who just arrived from school had a conversation with her mother. She said, “Mama, I really want to continue my studies in high school. Please, let me go to school.” Her mother replied, “I, too, have the desire to let you continue your studies, but you know very well our situation. Your sister is still in school and it’s hard to send you both, but your father and I will promise that the moment your sister is finished from her course, you will continue your schooling.”        Angelie was very happy with her mother’s assurance. She felt secured that in few years time she could continue her studies and eventually be able to start fulfilling all her dreams for her family.        When her sister graduated from her course, Angelie then enrolled in the same school where she continued her studies. Because she didn’t want to give much burden to her parents, she decided to apply as a working student. While she was striving in both her studies and work, she could not erase from her mind the time when she was still in their ancestral home.        She missed her family, but because of her determination to finish her course, she tried not to be carried away by her emotion. Her family has become her inspiration to reach her goal in life.        She, then, was able to finish her course and later found a good job. Even if she had already a job, she still could remember her mother’s words of assurance that she will be sent to college which for her was the sweetest promise she ever heard from her mother.        Today, we know how much we need obedience. Let’s think of our family. When we are called, we obey. When we are told to do something, we obey. We, children should be taught that our parents exercise authority over us in the place of God.  In the story of Angelie, how did she respond when her mother called for her?  How    did Angelie obey her mother?Why did she obey?","If you were Angelie how will you show obedience to your mother when you will be asked to do the errands? Tell something about what Angelie did. What part in the story of Angelie do you like best?Why? God has willed that His authority should be delegated to others. Do you know of somebody whom God called to do something good for other people? Let us recall how God shows His love to people through the prophets.","","plan         The call of Abraham is very important in God’s        of salvation. It should be made known to the faith  people of God that Abraham had exercised great the    in His Word and a loving trust that God would fulfill        promises He made to him.        This is like the story of Adam and Eve: In the beginning, God gave Adam and Eve wonderful gifts that would make them one day share His life and love in heaven. They committed sin that separated them from Him. They spoiled the way God wanted to work His plan of sharing those gifts with all of us. God punished Adam and Eve, but He did not give up His plan. He promised that one day, He would send a savior to win back the gifts they had lost, and to lead us to our Heavenly Father.        Thousand of years later, God called Abraham to help Him carry out this plan. God asked Abraham to do many hard things. The first was to leave his country and go away into another land that God would give him. Abraham obeyed God and He would make him the father of a great nation. Abraham’s wife had no child at this time but Abraham believed God and trusted His word. God kept repeating this promise to test whether Abraham would believe and obey Him. One night, God told Abraham to look up and try to count the stars. God promised Abraham that it would be just as impossible to count his descendant. God made another promise to Abraham that he would be the Father of His chosen people, to give them a land of their own and to bless and protect them always.      Through the prophets, God forms his people in the hope of salvation, in the expectation of a new and everlasting Covenant intended for all, to be written on their hearts.                                                                                               CCC 64  The sacred history of God’s own people begins with Abraham. God called Abraham and He answered, “Yes” to God. He became the “Father of all nations.”","God also chose Moses to do a special mission for Him. That’s why, God saved Moses. God waited for the right moment to tell Moses of his special work. Moses argued, but God wanted him to obey. Then, Moses became the leader of the Hebrews, they were considered as God’s Chosen People. Even if Moses find it very hard to do the work God gave him, he showed his faith and trust in God. He kept on trying his great work because he wanted to do God’s will.        Another prophet whom God called was Samuel. God kept on calling Samuel, giving him a message against Eli’s family from beginning to end. Samuel was afraid to tell Eli when he was asked, but Eli did not argue, hence, it is the Lord who said everything to Samuel and all Israel listened to him.        Now God has called us into His family. It is for each of us to prove our faith and obedience in our lives. He wants us to obey Him and love Him.        Let us always trust that God will keep His promise to take us to heaven. We must do what God wants us to do everyday.        We can show God that we love Him by listening to those who are placed over us and following what they tell us to do.        Even though sometimes, we are tempted by the devil not to do what is right but God protects us by giving us what we need to live on this earth as members of His family.  1 Who is Abraham? What did God ask him to do?                                                                                  2 Who is Moses? What did God ask him to do?  3 Who is Samuel?

He was known to be the wealthiest man in their place. Many of his neighbors worked for him in their rice field. Mang Garyo had a heart for the poor. He helped the needy, and gave job to the people who needed it. Mang Garyo was known to be a generous man in their barrio. He was married to Aling Rosana, who was known to be the prettiest woman in their place during her time. Mang Garyo and Aling Rosana raised two daughters; Mariane and Dianne.

Above all, our existence is sustained by God, our Creator. Without God nothing could come into being.        In the first part of the Bible, God’s love was seen and communicated in words and deeds to people. He continues to communicate to us through the prophets, especially through His Words in the Bible.        In the second part of the Bible, Christ is the ultimate sign that carries a message from God for all of us. In most of Jesus’ teaching, He made use of parables to proclaim the Good News to make him known and loved. His words are close to the heart of the people and are clearly understood by everyone. Jesus also performed miracles which revealed the truth that He was sent by the Father for His great love for us.        Today, we read stories from the Bible. The word Bible means “many books”. The Bible is made up of seventy-three books. It contains the Word of God and the story of God. We believe that the source of our faith is the Holy Scripture. The author of the Bible is God. The human authors were inspired by God to unite about God’s presence and guidance in their lives. The writers chosen by God wrote His story using the language of the human beings.","The unity of the two Testaments proceeds from the unity of God’s plan and his Revelation. The Old Testament prepares for the New, and the New Testament fulfills the Old; the two shed light on each other; both are true Word of God.           CCC 140  We continue to love God and others as we open our Bible everyday to know the stories and           traditions of God’s Family. When we read  the Bible, we come to know that God has  great    love for us. The word of God nourishes the           wholeness of our Christian life. Jesus  shows    us God’s great love for us through his  words and deeds especially in the paschal mystery. As we continue to learn moral lessons from the  parables of Jesus, we follow His examples, and we are nourished and strengthened to do good to  others.        As Catholic boys and girls, we learn to read and appreciate the Word of God as we reflect and meditate on it in the daily Scripture, Word of God, the Bible.  1.

I                                   was then, a  child before as                                         naughty as  the mischievous                                         princess in a  “telenovela” if you still                               remember. I  was scolded by my                                                          mother  because taking a bath                                   was not in  line with my routine                                    and I know  that she will only give two pesos for my baon. It is not enough for me! My mother always nagged me.  She would run after me bringing a guava stick. Unfortunately, it hit me and ouch! A bruise appeared.  But I was so lucky my grandmother would always be a hero to protect me, though, she finds fault in  me. She spoiled me sometimes.","Throwing clothes at the backyard was my only way to banish my anger and of course to have my revenge against them. Without my knowledge, it brought trouble to my parents. I experienced kneeling down on the salt. My father said, “Don’t stand until I say something! I did not raise you to become hard-headed child, but how come you act that way? What do you really need? Have I not been a good father to you?”        All night long I reflected on those words. Then promises were made. “Being naughty is enough! It’s time to grow! To be a good daughter is my way to please them. To work hard for my studies would be the greatest thing I will fulfill. Above all, I will learn accepting things and to be contented of what they can give.”        Suddenly, a tight hug consoled me. It was my father. Whispering to him, “I will be one of the stars you are aspiring for, Papa. I promise.” I said.        It was very difficult for me to utter the word “sorry” I know it is a powerful word to hear.        My father was grateful for my renewed attitude and he said, “Thank you my child. I will wait for that star to shine not only to give me brightness but also to spread that brightness to everybody, for them to know how bright is my life now for having a star like you. Just keep on believing. I know you can make it.”        How lucky I am to have a father like him. If only I can bring back the past, I will be a more responsible daughter to him. Despite my struggles, I know its part of God’s plan for me. He knows what is best for my future.

God wanted a mother for His Son, someone more beautiful and good than all other mothers. So, God made Mary very beautiful, very holy, and without sin. God looked at Mary and saw how good she was and how she was always trying to please him. God sent an angel to Mary. He asked her if she would be the mother of His Son, Jesus. Mary said, “Yes” she was so happy to do just what would please God. Mary became the mother of Jesus.        But no one else knew. People who saw her thought she was more wonderful than all other women. She was pleasing to God. Mary kept her secret. Joseph was told by an angel that he should marry Mary. The angel also told him the secret. Joseph was chosen by God to be the foster father of Jesus and he had to protect Mary. They lived in Nazareth when they were suddenly told they had to go to their town where their family came from. They had to sign their names. So, Joseph and Mary had to travel to Bethlehem. They were poor, and yet they had to take what they would need. Joseph packed their things on the back of a donkey and he let Mary ride while he walked. It was about ninety-five miles. They did not complain for they knew this was what God wanted.","When Mary and Joseph arrived in Bethlehem they were tired, and they looked for a place to stay. Since so many people came to Bethlehem there was no room in the inn. Joseph found a cave in the hillside outside of the town. It was here that Jesus was born. Angels came from heaven to announce the Good News to the shepherds. They hurried to find the newborn Savior. How happy they were! God made a bright star appear which led the Wise men from the East to the newborn King of the Jews. They, too, adored and loved the savior.           God’s love for Israel is compared to a father’s love for his son. His love     for his people is stronger than a mother’s for her children. God loves his     people more than a bridegroom his beloved: his love will be victorious over     even the worst infidelities and will extend to his most precious gift: God so     loved the world that he gave his only Son.”                                                                                                        CCC 219        When Mary and Joseph were looking for a place to stay, they did not complain. They were calm, quiet, and full of joy though they were so weary from a long journey. Yet, Mary and Joseph were happy and they accepted the poor cave for their home that night. This was what God had planned for them. They knew He would take care of them.  of God                                                 Mary and Joseph taught us to think we are                                           when our plans are changed, or when                                                  in trouble.

My father is a proud army soldier and so I am proud of him, too. As his duty demands, he works far from us dictated by his oath to serve his country and his family. I accepted the fact that I grew up without my father beside me. With this perception, a gap was build between my father and I.        I can still remember my childhood days, when the heavens has just finished bathing the earth, the soil was still soft and the air seemed cold touching my skin. Being alone without anything to do, I jumped over the stagnant water again and again until I fell down and got dirty. I reported to my teacher and she advised me to go home and change my clothes. I passed by the District Hall to meet my mother who was working at the mailing office. She told me to go home and gave me four pieces of banana cue to be shared with my siblings. As I was walking at the park, I saw a father together with his wife and their children. They were very happy. I can’t forget the smile of the children when they saw me. I stopped for a while and convinced myself that I am not jealous but deep inside I really want my own father to come home soon. As I arrived home, I found no one and nobody was there. I fixed myself alone, as I used to do things alone when my mother is out. As I grew older I started to see the importance of my father’s presence. I have not experienced the love and care of my father. I expected him to come home but before his schedule to visit us, we learned that he met an accident and he died on the spot. I missed him but he left us with a good and loving mother to take good care of me, my sister and my three brothers in the family.        God reflects His goodness, beauty and perfection in creation.

God is also the First Person of the Blessed                          Trinity. There are two other Persons; God the Son  and                     God the Holy Spirit. They are equal to each other.  It is a mystery, something we cannot understand. We believe the mystery of the Blessed Trinity because  God revealed it to us.        We learn many things about God, our Almighty Father from the Bible. We know about God when we look out into the night and see the beautiful and shining stars. It tells us about the greatness of God. We also know God is near when we see the sun rise each morning. We see the sky change colors and the leaves of the trees change colors, too. We see the flowers and other plants and animals grow. From all the good things around us, we know that God loves us. The world is like a great picture book telling us about God.","God our Father sent His own Son Jesus to share His life and love with us. By rising from the dead Jesus gave us a little look at the great glory and happiness of God which will make us happy forever.        By thinking of this wonderful mystery of God’s life more and more, we shall grow to understand what a tremendous thing God has done for us in giving us a share in His life.        God helped us to know about this wonderful mystery of Him. It is called the mystery of the Blessed Trinity.      God is the Father Almighty, whose fatherhood and power shed light on one another. God reveals his fatherly omnipotence by the way he takes care of our needs; by the filial adoption that he gives us (“I will be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughter, says the Lord Almighty”)                                                                                               CCC 270        We  realize the love of God, the Almighty Father    for us. He made all good things around us. Our   parents, teachers and friends teach us about     God and the wonderful things he has given     and has done for us.        We recognize what we learned that God knows us and everything about us. He knows and loves us more than anyone else does. God has given us many gifts and senses: hands and feet to touch, eyes to see, ears to hear, nose to smell, mouth to speak, tongue to taste, a mind to think, and choose, and the power to love Him. But He has given us a much more wonderful gift, more than our hands and feet, it is our soul.        To show that we are happy for God’s love and care for us, we should thank Him, pray to Him, and love Him.","Answer the questions briefly:                                                                            1 What happens to people who live                                                                            comfortably?  2 How do we show appreciation for what God has given us?  3 Why did God choose to save Noah?  4 How do we take care of God’s creation?  5 How do we fulfill our part of the covenant?       As Catholics, we are part of God’s family. God promised us His friendship, if we worship Him alone  and become faithful in His service.       Let us learn more about loving God by always looking for signs of God’s presence around us.

For a while, it looked like the state police officer was the murderer, but I believed the reporter did it”","‘How could you be so sure?John Ray asked, “I first thought the brother-in-law did it. Then, I was convinced that the drunkard had done it by accident. When they found the notes in the folder, I thought the newspaper publisher was the killer.”        “No, no, no!” Cris John went on. “The clues were there all along. All you had to do was follow the clues. The footprints in the garden, the broken glass by the fire place, and the notes in the folder, all pointed to the reporter. He was lying to both the brother-in-law and the state police officer.  “I was never sure who did it.” John Ray said, “But it was really a great movie!”        “Sure, it was a great movie!” Cris John said. The two boys walked all the way home discussing the twists and turns of the exciting plot.       What makes a mystery so exciting is that some of the facts are known, while some of them are  hidden,  to solve a mystery, the detective has to look  for clues  – tiny   hints about what happened at the time of the  crime.   Then, the detective carefully puts all the clues  and      hints together to get a picture of what  happened and who committed the crime. What makes mystery stories so much fun for the readers  or the viewers is thinking along with the detective as he or she puts all the pieces together.        The early Christians often referred to Jesus as a mystery. While they did not mean exactly what the writers mean when they write mysteries, the early Christians did mean that they had to search for Jesus. Part of Jesus’ identity was revealed. Part of that identity was still hidden. Those who love and believe in Jesus have to follow clues and hints to get a better picture of Him as the Son of the Living God.  -What is a mystery? -Why are mysteries so exciting for people? -Have you ever followed clues to make some important discovery? -How does it feel like when you made your discovery? -What have you discovered about Jesus?        God published the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospels but not in an ordinary book. God does not want people only to know about His Son but He wants everyone to believe in Jesus and to live his teachings. So, the Gospels are much more like mystery books. You have to dig, search, and believe to discover who Jesus is.","activity:           Ask your parents to trace your family.

Every time you go to Mass,  you hear a reading from the Gospels. The lessons  and                                teachings of Jesus are found in the Gospels, the  little that is known about the facts of His life is found  in the Gospels. The names of the Apostles, the places Jesus visited, where He suffered, and how he  died is all found in the Gospels.        It is important to remember that the Gospels are not Jesus’ diaries or autobiographies. The Gospels are stories written by people who loved Jesus and remembered what He was like. At first, nothing much was written about the life of Jesus. Whenever believers gathered, they would talk about Jesus. The Apostles or other disciples who knew Jesus would tell about Him and share His message with the group. Usually, they answered questions that came from the people – questions about what it meant to be a follower of Jesus. People wanted to know what made them different or special. The Apostles and other leaders used stories about Jesus or stories Jesus Himself told to help the Christians understand themselves.      “Son of God” signifies the unique and eternal relationship of Jesus Christ to God his Father: he is the only Son of the Father, he is God himself. To be a Christian, one must believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.                                                                                               CCC 454       When Jesus taught, he used some sentences over and over. He used sayings, parables and stories  and so that his hearers would remember His teaching. Remember that Jesus did not hand out sheets  of paper with His message on them. He did  all his                            teaching with words and actions.                                     After the resurrection and the  coming                             of the Holy Spirit, the apostles used what  they had learned from Jesus. They adapted their message to the different people and places they  visited.","The Gospels also contained what the followers of Jesus considered most important. You might have lots of questions like, “How does Jesus look like?” “How tall was he?” “What color was His hair?”        The early believers, however, were much more concerned about His words, His stories, His actions, and the effect Jesus had on people. So, that is what was written down.        Being members of the Church and followers of Jesus, we study the word of God and pray for guidance of the Holy Spirit to help us understand the teachings of Jesus.        The Gospels are like a gift from a friend that the more we use the gift, the closer we feel and become to our Friend, Jesus Christ.        It is important for us to read and study the Gospels each day to learn more about Jesus and we must practice what we read from the passage that struck us.

He went with his uncle to look for a job. He","was very friendly. He loves the company of his friends more than his family. He listens to his friends more than his parents.","One day, his uncle scolded him because he did not work in the carpentry shop. Instead, he stayed long in the computer, opened the face book and chatted with his friends. He thought his uncle did not want him to talk to his friends. He had so many ill thoughts about his uncle, so he decided to leave him. He did not come home for a month.        He went to his friends in Borneo to seek shelter and attention but to his disappointment, no one offered help.  Ralphy felt so alone. He never thought his friends could do this to him.       We have our parents and guardians who love and take care of us. They always think of the best  for us.     They attend to whatever we need. However,  some        of us do not see this. Other children do not value  much        what God has given them through their parents  and         whoever is taking good care of them.

The Church has million of members. So, the great Family of the Church is also composed of many smaller families. These smaller families are called Parishes. In the Parishes, the People of God worship, learn, and help others to join as one big family.        We are members of the Catholic Church. The Church is a group of people called together by Jesus. The people of the Church come together to worship, to learn, and to help others. The people come together to listen to God’s Word from the Bible. They learn how to follow Jesus. They share in worshipping God. The members come together in the Parish Church to share the Eucharist. This is an important time for them to unite with one another at Mass. They thank the Father for His great love, care, and for all His gifts.","The members of the People of God want to learn more and more about Jesus and His life. In the church, they hear God’s Word explained by the priest. They also celebrate feasts that help them remember who they are and how to live like Jesus.      At all times and in every race, anyone who fears God and does what is right has been acceptable to him. He has, however, willed to make men holy and save them, not as individuals without any bond or link between them, but rather to make them into a people who might acknowledge him and serve him in holiness.

Christians also help one another. They help their fellow Christians who are in need or in trouble like the victims of all calamities. Christians also help all people not just other members but everybody. Jesus wants us to do our share to help out the poor people. Helping is a sign of love.

She wanted  to eat her  meal the  way she     always  did. Helen ate  by morning  around      the table  and taking food from the plates of her family. Helen had been blind and deaf since the age of two.  The sickness had turned this bright baby into someone who could not see or hear. Now, Helen was  seven.","Helen’s family loved her, but they did not know what to do with her. So now, there was somebody new in Helen’s life. That person was teacher Anne. Helen’s mother, Kate, had asked teacher Anne to come and live with them. She accepted to teach Helen how to behave like other people.        When Helen reached her Teacher Anne’s plate, Anne pushed Helen’s hand away. She made Helen sit in her own chair. Helen got up again, but teacher Anne pushed her down. “You must learn to obey,” she said. Helen could not hear her. Helen’s mother began to weep. Teacher Anne asked the family to leave the room. She wanted to be alone with Helen.        When the family had gone, the teacher sat down in her own chair. She tried to finish eating her breakfast. Helen threw herself on the floor. She grabbed Teacher Anne’s chair and tried to pull it out from her.        Teacher knew it was important for Helen to learn to do things in the right way. She knew that some people thought Helen couldn’t learn things because she couldn’t see or hear. These people said that Helen should be put in a special home. Teacher Anne wanted to have a chance to live with Helen like everyone else.  At last Helen gave in. She sat quietly at the table and ate her breakfast.  In the story of Helen, describe how would you feel if you were in her place. Just imagine teacher  Anne was very tired, but was compassionate to her pupil. She smiled at Helen and took her in her  arms                                     around the yard. Helen learned many things  from                                     her teacher.  -What                                    can you say about the situation of Helen? -  What                                     are the two things that teacher Anne did for  Helen? -In what way did Teacher Anne teach Helen? -Do you think it was easy for Teacher Anne to  help Helen? -Have you ever had an experience in which you had to learn something very  difficult?Explain why? -Who helped you?","-How did the person help you? -What do you need in order to be successful in life?","the                                      Mary is honored under various titles: Mary, of the                             Mother of Jesus, Mary at Cana, Mary at the foot many                               Cross, Mary the Mother of the Church, and                                    other titles.        As a Mother, Mary is interested in us, her children. She teaches us and helps us to grow in holiness. She always shows us Jesus and tells us to imitate Him and to be like Him. We can go to her whenever we are in need.        Devotion to the Rosary should be promoted. The mysteries point out Mary’s intimate role in the redemption. The feasts of Mary give us ample opportunity to know and praise her together with her Son for God’s glory.        The liturgical prayer gives more meaning to feasts days. The shrines of Mary help us to understand Mary’s message especially to do penance, to say the Rosary, to honor her in some special way.      Since the Virgin Mary’s role in the mystery of Christ and the Spirit has been treated, it is fitting now to consider her place in the mystery of the Church. The Virgin Mary…. is acknowledged and honored as being truly the Mother of the Son of God and mother of the members of Christ.”                                     CCC 963        We learn many titles of Mary. When we recite the Litany of the Blessed Virgin, we are reminded of her role as the Mother of the whole Church.                                     When the Holy Spirit made Mary the  Mother                             of the Redeemer, He gave her a share in  her Son’s work of saving us. Mary belongs to  the Church. She is your Mother, your leader  and                                Mother of the Church. Since Mary is the  Mother of Jesus and also our Mother; therefore, Jesus is our brother. We honor Mary by praying the  Rosary. Mary is connected with Christ in His work of redeeming us. By thinking about the mysteries, we  learn to do His will as Mary did.","We pay homage to Mary in special way in the month of May. It is Mary’s Month. We show our special devotion to Mary. We make an altar in her honor and keep fresh flowers on it. We sing hymns to Mary and pray to her, too.        October is the month of the Holy Rosary. We focus our love and devotion by being faithful in meditating the mysteries in the life of Jesus and Mary.        Mary took good care of Jesus, taught him, fed him, and enjoyed being with him. Like any mother, when her boy suffered, she suffered with him. When Christ suffered His passion and death, Mary suffered with Him. She offered her Son Jesus to the Father all His life but she offered Him especially at the foot of the cross. Jesus asked Mary to be the Mother of the whole Church; she would have to take care of us, her children. That is why we pray: “Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death, Amen.” We must pray to Mary and ask her to be Mother to all people who suffer from the hands of the enemies of God. If we pray to a Mary, she will help us and help those who suffer.  A. Mary, the Mother of Christ was always in His presence. We pray to her to help us keep Christ’s                                                                            presence with us. How do we do that?

Simple recall: Answer the following questions:        -Why is Mary called the Mother of the Church? -What will Mary do for us? -What should we do to       honor Mary?        Mary teaches us, her children. She wants us to grow in holiness that is to be like her son, Jesus. At the marriage feast at Cana, she said, “Do whatever He tells you.” So we know she wants us to be perfectly obedient.","Since Mary is our Mother, we must be her obedient children. -Write at least three things that you do at home, in school or in the community        which shows obedience to Jesus and Mary. -Name some of the things you do to honor your mothers on special days. -How do you grow everyday in your love and devotion to Mary?

In the Beatitudes, Jesus tells us that true happiness cannot be found in acquiring all the things that we want but in believing that what we have are meant to be shared with others.        Jesus promises us that if we experience loneliness and suffering because we are doing what God wants, then we shall be rewarded with God’s consoling love.        Jesus shows us how we can be merciful. He showed His love for us even to His enemies. He did not refuse help to anyone. He wants us to extend our helping hand to the needy, without thinking whether those people are our friends or our enemies.        Jesus teaches us that a clean heart gives us the power to love truly, to put God first in our life, frees us from sin in order to grow more fully as faithful disciples of Jesus.        Jesus teaches us to be peacemakers. Let us refrain from quarreling with others or causing others to quarrel and connect people who are separated by difficult beliefs and practices.           Christ enables us to live in him all that he himself lived, and he lives it     in us. “By his Incarnation, he, the Son of God, has in a certain way united     himself with each man.” For it is the plan of the Son of God to make us and     the whole Church partake in his mysteries.                                                                                                       CCC 521","All of us                                           want to be happy, but not all of us find                                                     happiness in the same things.                                                      What makes you happy?This may be  a thing,                                            a person, a place, or an event. We look  for happiness, but Jesus tells us where we can really find happiness. Happiness is granted to:  - the poor and the powerless; - the gentle and those who are suffering; - those who do what is right with all their heart; - those who are merciful and clean of heart; - those who turn from violence and - to those who seek peace and reconciliation.        There are many things that make us happy. When our parents give us many things, we are very excited. Sometimes, we do not want anyone to touch these things. Sometimes, we do not want to share them with others. There is nothing wrong when we enjoy the things we have, the gifts we received, the company of people we love and are close to us. What is wrong is when we focus our attention on these things to the point that we no longer see the real importance of these things in life. We no longer see how these things can make us really happy and give us the true happiness that Jesus is talking about in the Beatitudes.        When we share with others the things we have, we show detachment. It means that we will not be sad because our happiness does not depend on these things or persons but on Jesus.

It was Saturday morning, I got up early, put on my favorite jersey and got ready for our practice. When I arrived at the court, I met Julius, a science club member who wants to try something new just like me. Since then, we became friends. Coach Cervantes told us to do the warm up before we start basketball training because it is very important for our health. After the warm up, Julius and I had difficulties in dribbling, I didn’t know why, but I said: “I can work it out”. After the practice, our coach gave us some reminders to follow.           Be punctual,” Don’t be late.          Eat more vegetables with carbohydrates for energy.          Drink water. Don’t let your body run out of water,.          Practice everyday.          Improve your skills.          Have confidence and trust yourself so that what might seem impossible would become possible.          Do not forget that the most important thing to do is to begin your practice with a prayer.        After listening to the reminders, thoughts entered my mind, that I have to practice sportsmanship, too. I felt more confident that my dream would come true, not only to become the most popular person but also a good player and a better Christian.

God willed that His chosen People would obey His commands and always keep the knowledge of the true God to love and serve Him.        God made man in His own image and likeness. He gave him gifts of body and soul which would enable him to know, love, and serve God. Man has an intellect and free will. He has a conscience which helps him to know right from wrong. If he violates God’s law his conscience makes him feel guilty. All authority comes from God. He is the Source of all law and through Christ, He established His Church and His authority.

Secondly, it is given to the bishops of the Church, successors of the Apostles and likewise from them to the priests, religious, and lay people who have the authority to teach the Sacred Doctrine of the Faith.        It is the Christian’s duty to know God and to learn how to live his life in relationship with Him, so that one day, we may return to Him in His heavenly glory.

It is a very rich town because most of the people living there are fishermen asking blessings from the sea. Because of this, everyone in this place is always happy and contented. They help one another in times of need and give whatever they could afford to give and to help someone who is poor. For many years, the people of this town lived happily and peacefully. Few of them became businessmen.","As a progressive town, the effort of the people motivated them to grow in their business and live happily while others succeeded with good economic standard of living. The people were happy with these progress but a calamity hit the town. The storm that came was very strong which brought great destructions. It also brought famine to the town. Rice fields were all damaged; fishermen were prohibited to go to the sea. Unfortunately, the storm lasted for three days leaving everyone’s cupboard empty. The happiness of the town was suddenly gone and they all became sad folks but the people had always depended on God’s providence. They never forgot to pray.        All the people of this happy town seemed to lose their hope, when all of a sudden, trucks of relief goods came. They brought foods, clothes, and other assistance. The darkness in the faces of everyone was gone and happiness came to their faces again. Happy town turned to be a merry town again.  How did the people of Happy town live their simple way of life? How did they experience trials and           sufferings? Why do you think was their place           destructed by the storm? How did the people  rely on  God’s providence? How do you show love and           concern at home?In school?In the community?  Example: We must attend Mass first before going out for a picnic. Loving God                  demands action on our part to show that we really love Him. God gave us commandments so that we may know Him and realize how important He is to us.","We have learned from the Bible that love of God and love of neighbor must go together. This means that if we say we love God, we must obey God’s command for us to love others.        If we look around, we notice that there are many who do not really show love of God and love of neighbor in their lives.        Jesus teaches us that we should love one another. Through this love, others will know that we are the followers of Jesus. Through the love we have for one another, others will see that God is really a God of Love.","This is how we show love for others. We show our care and concern for others.  1 We feed the hungry. 2 We give drink to the thirsty. 3 We clothe the naked. 4 We shelter the homeless. 5 We visit those in prison. 6 We visit the sick.        We also show our love for others not only through these loving acts of mercy but by means of responding to the spiritual needs of our neighbor.  1 We teach the ignorant. 2 We call the attention of the sinner. 3 We guide those who are confused. 4 We comfort those who are sad. 5 We forgive all injuries. 6 We pray for the living and the dead.        Loving others means not only giving material things but also sharing our time by going out of our way to comfort those who are lonely, sick or alone. Loving others also means doing acts of sacrifices.           You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There are no other     commandment greater than these. The apostle St. Paul reminds us of this:     “He who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. The commandments, you     shall not commit adultery, you shall not kill, you shall not steal, you shall not     covet and any other commandment, are summed up in this sentence, You     shall love your neighbor as yourself. Love does no wrong to a neighbor;     therefore love is fulfilling of the law.”                                                                                                      CCC 2196","also                                               Jesus did not only teach by words. He all.                                         taught by example. He always had time for                                              He even fed the hungry. He blessed the happy.                                       children. He loved everyone, even those                                              whom other people found difficult to love. He                                              went about doing good and making people        Jesus showed us how to love. We realized the importance of showing good examples to our brothers and sisters at home. We helped our neighbors by giving baked cookies to someone who is hungry. We also realized that we were doing acts of mercy when we visited the abandoned children and gave them what they needed. We made some friends recognized their wrong doings by correcting them with care and concern.        We thank God in our prayer for showing us how to love others sincerely. We are grateful to Jesus who taught us how to love our neighbors through His example.  A.

How do we show our care and concern for them?        Justice tells us that we should treat others the way we want to be treated by them. How do we show respect for others and also to the things that belong to them?  To be truthful means to refrain from lying. How do we follow Jesus who is telling the truth?

They had one daughter, Gemma, studying in a big school in the city which is far from their place.","One day, Gemma came home to ask money from her parents to pay for her tuition fees. She asked an amount more than what she needed for her food provision during the month.        Few days after, Gemma came home again and asked for another bigger amount because she needed it for their school activity. The parents did not give her anymore, but instead, they went to the principal of the school and verified about the academic performance of Gemma. The parents discovered that their daughter did not study well because she was always out of the school campus and had many absences from her classes.        Unluckily, the parents were also informed that Gemma was tempted to keep the personal accessories of her companion in the dormitory where she was staying. Gemma was charged to pay for the beautiful necklace she got without asking permission from the owner who was a friend of her.        Since Gemma wanted to finish her studies, she made a promise to study well and improve her grades. She tried her best to change her bad attitudes and she learned to share her things with others. She became generous and kind and followed the advice of her parents.        There are times when we feel that we must have what others have. We are tempted to get the things of others because we like them even though we do not really need them.  Let us look at the story of Gemma who always asked                                                                          money from her parents more than what she        needed. Why did she ask big amount of money  from  her parents? What happened to her when she  was far from her parents? Why was she tempted to get the beautiful necklace? If you were Gemma  what will you do? What happened to her after she received advice from her parents?","","shall        The Church is teaching us that any form of        unjustly taking or keeping the property of others is        against the seventh commandment. It tells us, “You        not steal.” It helps us to respect the properties and        goods of others.        The desire to take what others have like money, possessions or power can poison our minds and lead us to sin. It can lead us away from God whom we should serve alone.        The tenth commandment tells us to respect the property of others. On the other hand, it tells us, “You shall not covet anything that belongs to your neighbors.” You shall not desire your neighbor’s house, or anything that belongs to others. This desire for riches could lead us to harm others and make them suffer.        The Seventh and Tenth Commandments help us to practice the virtue of justice. We treat others with respect. If there is justice, there will be peace. They help us also develop the virtue of temperance which helps us recognize that material things are less important.  Filial respect promotes harmony in all of family life; it also concerns relationships between brothers and sisters. Respect toward parents fills the home with lights and warmth. “Grandchildren are the crown of the aged. With all humility  and meekness, with patience, support of one another in charity.”                                                                                              CCC 2219        As what we read from the Acts of the Apostles, it is very clear that Simon, the Magician, always wanted to be the center of attention. He held the Samaritans spellbound with his magic and when Philip entered the scene, he did not want to separate from him because he was making many                                                                                     miraculous signs. His greed for power                                                                                    became very evident when he offered                                                                                    money to the Apostles, Peter and John, in                                                                                    exchange for the “power” to give the Holy Spirit to the Samaritans through the laying on of hands. Peter rebuked Simon, the magician, for making such an offer, saying that he is poisoned with bitterness and in the grip of sin.","Another thing that challenged us is the desire for riches and power which could lead us to harm others and make them suffer like when we take or get the things that do not belong to us: when we do not return things that we borrowed; when we do not return extra change given to us; when we are envious of what others have; when we destroy the properties of others; or when we feel sad because of the success of others.        When we generously give others some of our things, such as toys, books, food, and clothes, it is a form of sharing. When we willingly talk, play, work and have fun with others, we share our time. Sharing is our way of telling them that we love them and care for them.        We can only become who we really are by caring and respecting the things of others.        Let us develop the virtues of temperance and justice in our day-to-day life to help us respect other people and their properties.  A.

The Ninang and Ninong are present and waiting for the short trip to the church. Aling Tiana, the mother of the baby boy, brings Diego to the church and waits for the baptismal ceremony. Father Sanchez, the Parish priest, is the one who will baptize Diego on the day of the feast of the Baptism of the Lord.        After the baptism, pictures were taken and everybody went back to the house for lunch.        When we were still babies, our mother and father took us to the church to be baptized by the                                                                           priest. This is when our Heavenly Father said to                                                                           each one of us, “I call you into my family. I want  you to be my child.”                                                                                  When the priest baptized us, the original sin we                                                                           inherited from our first parents was taken away that we become God’s children. We received the sanctifying grace. This made our Baptism day a very important and wonderful day. When a child is baptized, the child becomes a child of God and comes to live in him. It is just like God saying, “This child is now my child.’  What do you remember most about in the baptismal celebration?  Can you say what happens during baptism?  What gift do you received during your baptism?  What does Baptism give us?  activity:  How do you care for your spiritual life?","","At Baptism, God called us to leave the life we                              have received from Adam and Eve and take part  in a                        new life to share His own life and love. Because we                              were little babies, we could not understand God’s  call for us. Our parents and godparents said, “Yes” for  us. They must help us as we get older to keep on saying. “Yes” to God. Now that we are older, we can  understand more. We can say, “Yes” to God by ourselves. God has taken us into His family, the Church.  We became members of His Church. We are adopted children of God. We are taken into God’s  family, but in a much greater way than the way that the little babies were adopted. Since we are  brought into God’s family, our Heavenly Father gives us a gift that makes us like Jesus, His Son. When  Jesus rose from the dead, He won new life for us. With this, Jesus shares this new life with us in the  sacrament of Baptism. Now we must try to share this new life with others.           Through the sacraments of Christian initiation, man receives the new life       of Christ. Now we carry this life “in earthen vessels” and it remains “hidden       with Christ in God. We are still in our earthly tent,” subject to suffering,       illness and death. This new life as a child of God can be weakened and even       lost by sin.                              CCC 1420  Here are signs of Baptism:  1 Water – the pouring of water is the sign of new life. 2 White garment – signifies purity of the Christian. 3 Lighted Candles – signify Jesus as the light of the world. 4 Chrism -a perfumed oil, a sign of union with Christ through the coming of the Holy Spirit.","Jesus shows each one of us the way  to live  as a child of God. We must do what  Jesus    would want us to do. How would we live  to be    like Jesus at home, in school, and at           play?Whenever we fail to do what Jesus  asks of us, we offend him. But we believe that He will forgive us the moment we ask forgiveness from  Him. Then we try harder to please him as a good child should. He is always ready to welcome us  back.        Each day, we must pray that we may always believe in God and thank Him for these great gifts. The gifts of faith, hope, and love are the wonderful and special gifts given to us at Baptism. Because of these, we should not worry about anything else as God promised to take care of us and provide everything that we need.        Our new life with God begins at our Baptism. To celebrate our new life, our parents and godparents make promises for us. Every year of our life, we learn more about what it means to be a member of the Body of Christ. We will fulfill these promises to show that the Holy Spirit is alive in us and that we belong to the Church.  -We participate often in the Holy Mass. -We receive Sacraments of Reconciliation and Holy Eucharist. -We read the Bible regularly. -We pray often. -We show love and care for others.  What is the sacrament that makes us members of God’s family? How did you become a child of God? Who shows you how to be a good child? What did Jesus share with you at Baptism? In what way can you follow the examples of Jesus being a good child?","God wants us to use the gifts of faith, hope, and  love  that He gives us. We tell God that we believe in Him,        hope in Him, and love Him, whenever we pray. We  use our faith showing we believe God, when we study our        Christian Living and read the Bible. When we do  these things, we show hope in God. We know that God will reward us with His life and love, and with  heaven. We also show God that we love Him. We want to read and study about Him.        When a child is baptized, the priest takes the place of Christ. There are special words and actions for the ceremony of Baptism.                                                                                   1 The priest goes to the entrance of the                                                                                  church to welcome the child and make the sign of the cross on the forehead of the child.                                                                                  2 The priest asks the parents and                                                                                  godparents in the name of the child to                                                                                  promise to renounce Satan and all his work. 3 The priest pours water on the child’s head at the same time he calls him/her by name and recites, “I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. 4 The priest anoints the child’s head with chrism. 5 A white garment is placed on the child as a sign of new life. 6 The parents light their candles to show that Jesus is the light of the world. Then, the priest and the people pray together.        Let us now recite the Baptismal Renewal. These are the promises made for us but were recited by our parents and godparents.

They are siblings but are rivals. Vic is the eldest. Andrew is the youngest. Andrew is a mischievous one. He always wants to get the things of his brother Vic.","One day when their mother went to the market, Vic found this to be the best time for revenge. He challenged his brother Andrew to a fight. They boxed each other so hard. They did not notice when their mother arrived from the market.        “My goodness, what are you doing Vic and Andrew?” She shouted and tried to separate the two. But, the two boys ignored their angry mother. So, the mother got the string beans from the basket and whipped her two sons so hard. The string beans were scattered all over the place. “Pick up the string beans,” the mother ordered angrily.        “Sorry mother,” the frightened boys said, “We will not do it again,” They were crying but they embraced and forgave each other. Then, the mother asked them to help in the kitchen.        The boys had a delicious viand that day. Both of them ate voraciously the cooked fish and string beans. They never boxed each other after that.  Our story points to a very clear teaching on the need to forgive others. Sometimes, it is hard to  forgive    when we quarrel our brothers and sisters at  home.      Our parents take time to talk to us about how  to forgive one another. We make sure, we should  know       how to say, “Sorry” and promise not to quarrel  again.  Questions  What can you say about the attitudes of the two boys who quarreled while their mother was away? What happened to them when their mother arrived from the market? How did their mother reconcile them? If you were in their situation, would you also do the same as what they did? What is the best way of showing repentance? What reminds us to stop doing what is wrong and to seek forgiveness?","","Throughout the public ministry of Jesus, he brings healing of body and spirit to the people around  him. He                always desires to ease any pain or burden  which                  anyone bears. His overflowing love instantly  cures                  anyone who approaches him with deep faith  and                    sincere repentance. This is why he gives His                         apostles the authority to forgive sins so that  many would be healed.        Through the miracle narrated to us in the story, Jesus shows the people His power to forgive and heal. However, the healing does not happen if there is no faith and conformity to the will of God.        We must follow what Jesus Christ wants us to do. He wants us to forgive not only once, twice, or thrice, but seventy times seven.        In Mark 11: 25 Jesus says, ‘When you stand to pray, forgive anyone against whom you have grievance so that your heavenly Father may in turn forgive your faults.” Therefore, it is very clear that we must always forgive in order to be forgiven by God. Jesus says, if you do not forgive others, neither will your Father forgive you.”            For those who receive the sacrament of Penance with contrite heart and        religious disposition, reconciliation “is usually followed by peace and serenity        of conscience with strong spiritual consolation.

We need to ask for the gift of forgiveness through the sacrament of healing and reconciliation. Therefore, we must prepare ourselves as we do the following steps:  1. We say our personal prayer silently and ask for the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit to help us recall       our sins.","We look back into our lives to review the things we have done, the things we did or didn’t do which hurt other people and is against the Will of God.

She was suffering from a terminal liver cancer.","Upon seeing her, I felt sad because I knew her days were counted. But when we talked, I discovered something. “Hi, how are you?” I said to her.","Her face showed with deep pain and suffering. I was so curious so I asked again, “Is it really very, very painful?”        She nodded and said, “I can’t describe the pain. All I know is that Christ’s suffering on the cross is much more painful than what I am experiencing now. He endured all His sufferings and pains to redeem us. He did not complain about it. So, I don’t have the right to complain, either. Just the thought of Christ’s suffering lessens the pain that I am experiencing now. My pains are nothing compared to Christ’s and so, I offer it too for the forgiveness of my sins and those of my fellowmen.”        When I heard that, I was speechless for a second. I was amazed by the strong faith Laleng had shown. I wish I could also do the same whenever I’m sick and suffering.        Before I could say a word, the doctor came in to check her. We didn’t have much time to talk until I left. After few days, I learned that God took her to her final home.        Suffering has a redemptive value for the individual, for the people of the Church, and for the whole world if it is offered for a good purpose.

The priest administers the Sacrament of Healing known  as the Anointing of the Sick. This sacrament gives the sick more grace and strength to bear his suffering.  In some cases, the priest administers Viaticum or Holy Communion given privately to someone in  danger of death, during an illness, or to soldiers going into battle.     “By the sacred anointing of the sick and the prayer of the priests the whole Church commends those who are ill to the suffering and glorified Lord, that he may raise them up and save them, uniting themselves to the Passion and death of Christ.”                                                                                                          CCC 1499        For every suffering, there is resurrection and there is hope.

Above all, we worship our God the Father through Christ, with Christ and in Christ, in the unity of the Holy Spirit.        The origin of the Holy Eucharist as a memorial meal can be traced back to the Last Supper which Jesus commanded His apostles to celebrate in His remembrance. Singing songs, listening to God’s Word, praying together, and receiving Holy Communion bring us together and closer as a community. Jesus has given of Himself to us as a gift and as food. Our giving of ourselves to one another is our gift to Him as a people.        The Holy Eucharist has these following effects on us: It unites us with Christ. It separates us from sin. It reconciles us with one another. It builds up the Christian community, the Church. Jesus promised not to leave us orphans, that is why, He instituted this Eucharist where He can remain with us in the Blessed Sacrament.","The Eucharist is the efficacious signs and sublime cause of that communion in the divine life and that unity of the people of God by which the Church is kept in being.

When my mother asked me, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” I answered, “When I grow up I want to be a teacher.” With more serious thoughts I asked myself.","“Shall I stay single, get married, or become a religious?” Well, decisions cannot be made overnight. I have to plan, consult someone for help and above all I have to pray and ask the enlightenment from the Holy Spirit. When it comes to the question of marriage, I cannot say something about it, since I am only in Grade Five. So I, take the case of my elder brother, Noli and his wife, Laila.        Noli and Laila are both fourth year high school students. They love to see each other most of the time. They work on their assignments together, eat together and go home together. They always stay away from others to be alone by themselves. They always go out of the house to spend longer hours of dating. Then they decided to stop schooling until they lived together. Their parents got angry but they arrived to the point of making arrangement for the wedding. They got married in the Catholic Church and both stayed together happily on their own. However, they did not continue schooling. They experienced trials and sufferings in life because they did not find a good job.        A happy family is the result when husband and wife grow in their love for each other as they care for the children that God entrusted to them. The children show appreciation for their parents’ concern by obeying them and fulfilling their responsibilities at                                                                           home.

Matrimony is a sacrament in which a man and a woman attracted by mutual love are joined by  Christ and His Church to a union which will last until death. The bride and the bridegroom are given  the grace to love each other with the love with  which   Christ has loved His Church. The married couple  commit  themselves to be happy and successful in          bringing forth and educating children who will  take    their place in the Kingdom of God.","Married life is a lifetime commitment to one another and to God, just as Christ, the Head, committed Himself to His body, the Church.        In Christian marriage, Christ calls two baptized people together into an intimate union with each other and Himself. Through this sacramental sign, they stand as witness to the world of the love which exist between two people and the love which Christ has for His Church. Through the graces of this sacrament, the married couple live their lives in love, always to deepen their union, and to achieve the perfection of holiness to which they have been called by God.          To speak of married love as friendship may seem quite at first right, but     real authentic friendship is our most unselfish, enduring mutual love,     grounded on our free unshakeable commitment to the other for the other’s     sake, not for our own good.

My father opened the conversation with a serious face and sincere words of faith. He shared to us the contribution initiated by the leader of our church. As I listened to the sharing of my father, I found it very interesting which made me appreciate our leader for his deeds and sacrifices. Our conversation ended with a good thought that remained in my mind.

The conversation we had during the night motivated me to continue my spiritual life as what I usually do. Before going to church, I tried to make sure that I am ready to present myself to God physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. While on my way to church, I reflected on how to prepare myself so that I could participate actively in the celebration of the Holy Mass and I could pray for the leaders and members of the Church.        We appreciate the complete necessity of prayer in our daily lives. Experience has taught us how                                        important it is to pray in everything we do. We know  that                                  we can do nothing by ourselves so we must pray to  God                                   for help in everything we undertake.                                                                                  Sometimes people allow things to take the place of God in their lives. They forget God and ignore their duty of keeping the commandments and receiving the sacraments.  Do we spend much time for ourselves and no time for God in prayer, in worshipping, at Mass and in going to confession?  Why do we have to worship God?  What is the greatest act of worship?  Why is it necessary to pray?  What happens when we neglect our spiritual duties?","How  do  hypocrites pray? What must you do when you pray? What do you ask from God when you pray? How should you pray? Why should we not follow the hypocrites when praying?        Prayer is the lifting of our minds and hearts to God in love. It is talking to God, Our Father, and uniting ourselves with Him. The test of love is the desire to be with the person we love, and to talk to him. In prayer, we speak to God, but we must also listen to Him.","There are two kinds of prayer: vocal and mental. It is necessary to show how the heart and mind should be engaged in all prayers, and how mental prayer is done with the heart and mind alone.        We are aware that prayer is necessary, and that God wants us to pray to Him. We must praise Him, thank Him, and ask Him for what we need and be sorry for our sins. We must bring our daily problems, our anxieties, our fears, and out worries to Him in prayer.        Vocal prayers are prayers that we say with words. They are prayers that we have learned by heart or that we read. Sometimes, we can make our own prayers, too. We must be aware of God’s presence with us. Then, we will find it easy to lift our minds and hearts to God wherever we are and whatever we are doing.  Mental prayers are prayers we pray with our minds and hearts alone, without words. It is called meditation or contemplation.     Whether prayer is expressed in words or gestures, it is the whole man who prays. But in naming the source of prayer, Scripture speaks sometimes of the soul or the spirit, but most often of the heart. According to Scripture, it is the heart that prays. If our heart is far from God, the words of prayer are in vain.

He is our loving Father who showers us with His gifts.        Through prayers, we should also show our good relationship with our parents. We must be sincere, humble, and trustful in our relationships that exist between us and God in prayer. The example from the Bible can also be used to show our relationships.        Dwelling on Mary and the Mysteries of the Rosary will help promote our devotion to Mary and the rosary. Through these, we can learn an easy method of meditation.        In prayer, we think about God, adore Him, love Him, and thank Him. Praying to God as our Father inspires a great love and confidence in us towards Him. We rely completely on Him for all our needs.

Materially, I was well-provided but my tired body did not need all those things, all I needed was rest and a loving touch that only a mother can give.        One early morning, a door in one of the rooms in the second floor was locked, and sad to say the key was lost. We destroyed the door to open it. My guardian was so angry and as a punishment she told me that I cannot have my allowance for the whole week. Without any complain, I went to school and walked alone by myself.        I was determined to go through those trials I encountered. I focused myself in school activities by participating in the reach-out program. My participation in that activity had developed my love and compassion to the poor and most of all to God.        It was Saturday, and our class was assigned to go to Salaysay, Marilog where one of the extension programs of Holy Cross was located. Our purpose on that day was to give school supplies and used clothings to the pupils and their parents. It was my first time to join the group and I thanked God for it was in that place where I witnessed the real simplicity of life. I saw pupils going to school barefooted. They did not have bags and papers. I felt pity on them. I remembered all my burdens and I tried comparing myself with them. I realized that I was lucky compared to them, but they were more happy than me.        I spent most of my time talking to those little children with their parents around. I helped my classmates in distributing the school supplies and whatever things and clothing we brought for them. It was the first time that I felt a strange feeling of happiness radiating from my heart. It was nice to hear people saying, “Thank You” for the little things we did. My experience that day made me realize that true happiness cannot be achieved by what we have but by what we have given from the heart. I realized that even if I don’t have everything, I still have something to give.  Everyone wants to be happy.        After listening to the story of Girlie, we realized the importance of reaching out to others even if we don’t have everything but we can give something for the poor and those who are suffering in pain.","What moved Girlie to help the children? What do you think Girlie felt when she saw the children without bags and papers and walking barefooted? If you were Girlie, how will you show your love and compassion to the poor children?

Her                                          daughters were the first object of her care, and        As it was her custom, she was led first to the classroom of the little girls who were poor; the students of the upper classes of society would be last. For, in a very tangible way, Mother Rivier saw Jesus Christ made poor for us in the children who were poor and wearing worn out clothes. In this particular classroom, she found a number of students who were deprived of everything because of extreme poverty. One of them was especially noticeable. She was a little girl of eleven or twelve, crippled, unattractive, and dressed in ragged clothing. But she was blessed with a good heart and with a mental keenness far beyond her age.        It was precisely this little girl that the teacher had chosen to deliver a complimentary address to the superior general, wanting to make use of a child according to Mother Rivier’s liking, and to give new substance to her spirit of faith. And so the little lame child walked towards Mother Rivier with her address in hand, and then she began to deliver it.        She read the first few lines with a clear, sure, and stirring voice-something delightful to hear. But when she reached the part that said, “We know, worthy and esteemed Mother, that you take pleasure in being with poor children and that you love them, and that is why we. . .” she could not continue, for her voice was breaking with emotion. She began to stammer, and then burst into tears . . . . Nevertheless, she tried again but in vain, she choked up, dropped her paper, and began to sob; seeing her this way, all her little classmates were also moved to tears.  Mother Rivier hurried to console the child. She said to her:        “Now that’s enough, my child, that’s enough, you’ve said such beautiful things! Oh, the wonderful compliment you gave me! How you’ve said the truth! Yes, I love poor children, and I love to be in their midst. Come here, my child. I want to kiss you for all your companions.”        So, the lame child came forward and had the joy of receiving a motherly hug from her loving mother.        Then, Mother Rivier gave each student a lovely little reward as she urged them to be faithful in attending classes; to work hard at their studies, and especially, to be respectful and always obedient toward their parents and teachers.","Nevertheless, she did not lose sight of the little girl who had delivered the address, for she was truly the poorest child in the class.        Before leaving the parish, Mother Rivier had the child dressed from head to foot in brand new clothes, after giving alms to her parents. Both the parents and the child were at a loss for words as they tried to express their gratitude to Mother Rivier.        We have heard the story of Jesus telling us about the rich man and Lazarus. But what is Jesus                                                                                    teaching us?Is he saying that it is wrong to be                                                                                    wealthy, or that all rich people are selfish?                                                                                    Does He mean that only beggars and poor                                                                                    people deserve kindness?        Christ does not mean any of these things. His story is about us. Each of us is the rich man. In other words, each of us has something to give or share with others. We also see the needs of others with whom we live, work, and play.        Our wealth is the richness of being a considerate person. Jesus knows that all men need things in order to live. He Himself needed things, and He helped those in need, too.        The story of Mother Rivier and the little lame girl teaches us to use everything in a loving way and to share our riches with others, show our concern, love, and compassion to poor people.        Above all, Jesus knows and cares about the needs of all people around us especially their sufferings.        If we make these teachings part of our life, then it means that we have the heart full of happiness.  Simple recall The Beatitudes show us how we can really follow the example of Jesus.  1. “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.” How will you help the poor?","“Blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted.” How do we comfort a person who is mourning?  “Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the land.” How can you help those who are suffering?  “Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be satisfied.” How can you help people who suffer from hunger?  “Blessed are the merciful for they shall receive mercy.” How does our example show mercy?  “Blessed are the clean of heart, for they will see God.’ How can you help a person who needs to have a clean heart?  “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.” When is peace present?  “Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.’ What does justice require?        The works of mercy are charitable actions by which we come to help our neighbors in their spiritual and bodily needs. How can we follow Jesus’ call to be merciful?What is the best way by which we can show our love and concern for others?  a at home?________________________________________________________________  .     __________________________________________________________________________     __________________________________________________________________________     __________________________________________________________________________  b  in school?________________________________________________________________ .     __________________________________________________________________________     __________________________________________________________________________     __________________________________________________________________________  c  in the community? _______________________________________________________ .     __________________________________________________________________________     __________________________________________________________________________     __________________________________________________________________________","Let us learn this song: Beatitudes:  1.
