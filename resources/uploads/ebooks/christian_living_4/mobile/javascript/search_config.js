The learners are introduced to the Sources of Faith of the Catholic Church. They gradually become convinced that Sacred Tradition is not the only way to know God for their holiness and salvation. This is a great treasure of the Church that must be adhered to and kept. The learners are introduced to read and understand the Sacred Scripture as God’s Word speak to them. The learners also need to know and understand the basic teachings of the Church and how these apply in their lives                               The Author  Marie Rivier, Woman Apostle","Lesson  God and His           Creation   1  Expected Outcomes: a. To realize that God is powerful, God is wise and God is love b. To show gratefulness to God and praise Him in His creation c. To pray and thank God for making Himself known to us  Life Situation                                           A Sculptor Man  illus based on book       Mang Ambo is a good man with seven children. He raised his family being a sculptor. His wife Aling Sally takes good care of their children at home. They live in a simple nipa hut located near the church.","One Sunday morning, after the Holy Mass, many people stopped in front of the house of Mang Ambo because of the display of nice carvings, figurines, and statues of some popular saints. People were amazed with the finished products made by Mang Ambo which made him known in their place as the Sculptor of the town.       The family of Mang Ambo was chosen as the model family of the year. He did not study in a big school but he has made use of the talents that God had given him. He earned their living by making statues of the saints which were ordered by some people especially the Catholic families who have a strong devotion to their favorite patron saints. He sells his product at a very reasonable price with a very minimal profit.       Mang Ambo is a humble man. He did not have the ambition to become rich. He just wants to be known as a simple sculptor in the town. He was able to send his seven children to school by being faithful to his work as sculptor with the help and inspiration of his wife and the support of his children.  Value Development       God wants Mang Ambo and his family to live in a simple way. Mang Ambo made use of the talent that God had given him.  What special talent did Mang Ambo receive from God?  How did Mang Ambo make his family happy?  Did Mang Ambo study sculpture in a big school?       How did Mang Ambo show gratitude to God for the gift and special talent he received being a good sculptor?","What do you think would happen to the children of Mang Ambo if he had no good job?       How do you make others happy using the talent that you received from God?  Do you think everybody received the same talent from God?       How about you, can you say that everything we have come from God?       Do you know of someone around us who made himself known and thought of making something beautiful in this world?","Proclamation of the Word of God       God is the Supreme Being, infinitely perfect, who made all things and keeps them in existence.       God created the world in six days. On the first day, He made the light which He called day and darkness which He called night. On the second day, He made the sky and divided the waters. On the third day of creation, God created the earth and the sea. On the fourth day, God made the sun to govern the day, the moon to govern the night, and He also made the stars. On the fifth day, He made all kinds of living creatures, such as: birds and fishes. On the sixth day, God made all kinds of wild animals and finally, He made man: male and female. Then, God blessed them, and said. “Be fertile and multiply, fill the earth and conquer it. Be masters of the fish of the sea, the bird of heaven, and all living animals on earth”. God saw all He had made and found them very good. God completed the work He had been doing and He stopped working. He rested on the seventh day. God blessed the seventh day and made it holy.                                                                       Adapted from Genesis 1:1 – 31; 2:1 – 4","","Knowing our Faith  God reveals Himself to us through His creation. God is great.         We acknowledge the greatness of God through all created things because He is the source of life and goodness. All His actions show His wisdom and love, especially when He formed man in His own image and likeness. (CFC 65 – 66)         We know about God’s power, wisdom, and love especially when we look at the world and all the things He made for us.  God is powerful.  He created everything out of nothing. He can do all things. He keeps everything in existence. He can do anything by a mere act of His will. Nothing is impossible with God.  God is all-wise.         The more we learn about the wonders of the universe the more we are amazed by the infinite wisdom of God. By His great wisdom, He made the stars and heavenly bodies. His knowledge is infinite.  God is love.         Love is part of His nature. He created us out of His love. God loves His creations far more than a mother loves the children she has borne.         God provides us the beautiful world to live in. He takes good care of our body and soul. He gives us graces day after day. He prepares for us a place in heaven. Above all, He sent His Son down to earth to die for us.","Challenges of our Faith       The more we learn about God’s creation the more we praise and thank Him because of the wonders and beautiful things around us.       God is all knowing. He knows all things past, present, and future even our most secret thoughts, words, and actions. God made the human being in His own image and likeness. Therefore, we share in this aspect of God because we also have the intellect and the will. As the highest of his creation, we have the responsibility to take care of His creation.       We know the various ways of learning about God from the people who speak about Him, and who show how loving He is. The love they show is a sharing in God’s great love. We can say that these people reflect God’s goodness. We have to respect and love them as we praise and adore God above all things. We help others to know about God and to love him more.  illus based on book","Enhancing our Faith       Many things here on earth are signs of God.

When I am in school, I will tell my classmates to take care of the plants around us by watering them everyday.       When I am in the church, I will join in praying and singing to thank God and praise Him for the wonders of the world.  Celebrating our Faith  Let us now pray and thank God for making Himself known to us through His creation. Girls’ Group will say: God, You are present in all things around us.

Let us praise and thank God.","Lesson The Bible is the Word of God    2  Expected Outcomes: a. To define the Bible as the Word of God b. To handle the Bible with respect, love and care c. To pray to the Holy Spirit that He will help us learn about the Word of       God  Life Situation                                        Sharing Good News      Nardo is a grade four pupil who comes from a poor family. He is the only child in the family. His parents died during the massacre in barangay Lampagang, a place far from the poblacion. When the incident  happened, Nardo was only a little boy at the age of six. He stayed with his Lola Martha who took good care of him until he started going to school.","When Nardo grew up, he continued his studies with the support of his Lola Martha. Later on, he decided to stop his schooling because he felt that his Lola cannot afford anymore to support him. Lola Martha was working hard for their daily sustenance as a seamstress.       One day, Nardo went to the store where the people bought newspaper everyday. He was given a job as a newsboy by the owner of the store because they were in need of personnel to sell newspaper every Saturday and Sunday. Nardo was very happy of his new job and gave thanks to God for the great help given to him.       Many people along the street called Nardo every time he went out to sell newspaper. They were amazed to see him because he did not only sell but also read the newspaper to update the people about the happenings around them both local and national.  Value Development       There are many ways of knowing many things around us. We learn about them through communication such as newspaper. Sometimes, people will share us the news they heard from others.  What can you say about the job of Nardo?  What do you learn from him?  Do you update yourself through global news?  How does it help you?  Where do you usually learn about the happenings around us or events within our milieu?  What kind of news would you want to know?","What happens if there are no ways and means of communication around us?       What do you think is the best source of Good News which is different from newspaper or TV broadcast? Activity:       Write at least 5 good news that you heard and share them with your seatmate.  1. 2. 3. 4. 5.   Proclamation of the Word of God  Noah had found favor with Yahweh. This is the story.         The Lord saw how great was man’s wickedness on earth. So God  said: “I will wipe out from the earth men and all the living things for I am","sorry that I made them. “But Noah found favor with God. He was a good man and he walked with God. Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.","God said to Noah, “The end has come for all things of flesh. I have decided this, because the earth is full of violence of man’s making and I will remove them from the earth. Make man’s making and I will remove them from the earth. Make yourself an ark out of wood. Make it with reeds and line it with pitch inside and outside. This is how to make it: the length of the ark is to be three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. Make a roof for the ark... put the door of the ark high up in the side and make a first, second, and third deck. For my part, I mean to bring a flood and send the waters over the earth to destroy all flesh on it. Every living creature under heaven; everything on earth shall perish. But I will establish my covenant with you and you must go on board the ark yourself, your sons, your wife, and your son’s wives along two each of each kind aboard the ark, to save their lives with yours; they must be a male and female. Of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of reptile on the ground, two must go with you so that their lives may be saved. For your part provide yourself with eatable of all kinds, and lay in store of them to serve as food for yourself and them. Noah did this; he did all that God ordered him.”       Yahweh said to Noah, “Go aboard the ark you and all your household for you alone among this generation do I see as a good man in my judgment.”                                                                       Adapted from Genesis 1:1 – 31; 2:1 – 4","Knowing our Faith       The Holy Bible is the most important of all books. It is defined as the Word of God. It is the best book in the world.       The Bible is divided into two main parts: the Old Testament and New Testament.  The Old Testament tells us about the happenings before Christ’s birth.       The New Testament tells us about the events that happened after the birth of Christ.       The Old Testament, written before Christ consists of forty five books.  a. Twenty – one historical books, relating to the history of the Jews,      among which books are the five book of Moses and four books of      Kings;  b. Seven doctrinal books, made up of prayers which are the Psalms and      the Proverbs;  c. Seventeen prophetical books, among which books are Isaiah,      Jeremiah, and Daniel.  The New Testament, written after the Ascension of Christ, consists of twenty – seven books.  a. The Four Gospels according to St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke and St.      John, containing the story of the “good news” of salvation.","b. The Acts of the Apostles, by St Luke, containing the history of the life      of the Apostles and the first Christian communities, after the Ascension      of Our Lord into heaven.  c. Twenty – one epistles by St. Paul, St. James, St. Peter, St. John, and St.      Jude; and  d. The Apocalypse by St. John which is also called Revelation         The Four Gospels and the Acts are mainly historical. The Epistles are doctrinal. The Apocalypse is prophetical.  Challenges of our Faith       Happy are they who hear the Word of God and keep it. That is what we must do. We must listen attentively to someone whom God sent to spread His Good News. Sometimes, when the message is read to us at Holy Mass, we don’t pay attention. It is important for us to listen, live it, and share it to other people we meet. If we listen attentively, we will grow in God’s love and learn to respect the Word of God.       The message we receive in the Holy Bible is from God. The Bible is the first most important book through which God speaks to us. He speaks to us not as one far away, but as one among us.       Great reverence has always been given to the Holy Bible because it is the Word of God.       It is important for us to listen to the Word of God with love and attention. We ask help from the Holy Spirit to enlighten our mind so that we can understand and will learn to live it faithfully everyday.","Enhancing our Faith  God’s Word comes to us through different ways.

In our school, the teachers read the Word of God in Bible before the class starts in the morning.       Let us make it a habit to read the Word of God everyday at home especially in the evening before we start making assignment. That is the way in which God speaks to us. We also share His message to others to help us grow in faith, love, and joy.       God’s Word comes to us in a most special way when we read the Bible at home, in school or in the church.  Celebrating our Faith       Let us put our hearts and minds in the presence of our Almighty Father. Our thoughts must match with our words. When we sing and when we pray, we must be thinking of what we are saying. We must make every effort to listen and talk to God:  1. Let us now sing a hymn:       “Enter rejoice and come in. Open our hearts to the Lord. Today will      be a joyful day. Open our hearts to the Lord. Sing Alleluia, sing alleluia.      Today will be a joyful day, Enter rejoice and come in.”  2. Let us now listen to the Word of God.       A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke 4:16-21            When Jesus came to Nazareth where He had been brought up,      He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath as He usually did. He      stood up to read and they handed Him the book of prophet Isaiah.","Jesus then unrolled the scroll and found the passage where it is written; “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me. He has anointed me to bring good news to the poor, to proclaim liberty to captives, new sight to the blind; and to free the oppressed and announce the Lord’s year of mercy.”       Jesus then rolled up the scroll and gave it to the attendant and sat down, while the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him. Then He said to them, “Today, these prophetic words come true even as you listen.”  This is the Gospel of the Lord.  Message from Marie Rivier  My dear children,                         Like Simeon, be people “of desire” like him, carefully                   read the Word of God and meditate it whole heartedly.","Lesson  We Respect the Word of                       God   3  Expected Outcomes: a. To realize that God tells us His message of love in the Bible; b. To give reverence for God’s living Word when we read the Holy Bible c. To pray and thank God for giving us the written Holy Word  Life Situation                                  The Source of all Knowledge      One day, Luz, Vicky, and Nemia went to school together bringing the books inside their bags. They were good children who always followed the instructions of their teacher in school. Their teacher advised them to take good care of their books because they learned many things from those books.","It was Friday afternoon when the school librarian made a surprise visit to their classroom and inspected all the books rented by the pupils. Some of the pupils did not cover their books. The librarian told them to cover their books so that it will still be in good condition when they return it to the library at the end of the school year.       Some pupils shared their experiences about what they learned from their books. They said, “We learn a lot of stories and lessons from them. We can study well, if we bring our books in school. When we are at home, we also study and read our books.”       After dismissal, the pupils went home but they were caught by the rain. They kept their books inside their bags and when they reached home the books were taken cared of even if the pupils were all wet. Their parents were happy to know that books were given special care by the children.","Value Development       It is important to take good care of our books at home or in school. They are the source of all knowledge.       From the short story, what did Luz, Vicky, and Nemia do with their books?  How did they take care of their books?  Why did they give special care of them?  Are these the only books that they need to take care of?       Do you think there is another book that they use at home or in school that they did not mention in their short story?       What about you? What do you think is the best book in the world, the most important book that you need in life?  Who made it for us?  Do you want to know how it came to us?  This book is                               holy. It  contains the                               word of  God. Through                               the stories  in the Bible,                              we hear  Him speaks.                                He also  invites us to                              share His  life and love.                             This Holy  Book should                                be  treated with                               great  reverence                                  and  placed it on a                             special  table, when not in use, if not on a lectern. If possible, during the  paraliturgy, two candles will be lighted on the altar. We can say that God  is always present when we read the Bible.","Proclamation of the Word of God      This is how Jesus Christ came to be born. His mother Mary was  betrothed to Joseph, but before they came to live together she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. Her husband Joseph, an upright man unwilling to expose her to the law, decided to divorce her quietly. He had made up his mind to do this when the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because she has conceived this child by the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son and you must name him Jesus, because he is the one who is to save his people from their sins.” All this took place to fulfill the words spoken by the Lord through the prophet, “the Virgin will conceive and give birth to a son and they will call him Emmanuel, a name which means God-is-with-us”. When Joseph woke up he did what the angel of the Lord had told him to do; he took his wife to his home.                                                                                                     Matthew 1:18 -24","Knowing our Faith       Let us be aware that the Bible is a special book to know God better. It is the most important book that teaches us about God. When we read His words, it helped us know and love God better. This book is Holy. It contains the Holy word. It comes to us from God. He speaks to us and tells us of His love for all of us.       In the first part of the Bible, the Old Testament, we learn about creation, how man sinned and God’s promise to send the Savior. The second part of the Bible is the New Testament. It tells us about the life and mission of Jesus. He says and does many things to lead us to His Father.       Every time we attend the Holy Mass, God speaks to us during the liturgy of the Word. In this part of the Holy Mass, we listen to the first reading, second reading, and the Gospel reading.       The first reading is usually taken from the Old Testament like the Book of Exodus, Wisdom and from the book the prophets etc. and the second reading is from the different letters in the New Testament like Letters of St. Paul, James, Acts of Apostles, etc. At the end of the readings, the people will answer, “Thanks be to God.”       During the Gospel reading, the people stand out of reverence for the Word of God. The reading is taken from one of the four Gospel Evangelists: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The priest begins the reading by making the sign of the small cross on his forehead, lips,and breast. The people do the same to show that they believe in the Gospel, and will always profess and love it. At the end of the Gospel reading, the priest will say, “This is the Gospel of the Lord.” The people will answer, “Praise be to you O Lord, Jesus Christ.”","Challenges of our Faith       We can learn about God from others but to know God better we must read His written Holy Words from the Bible. We must show respect and love for the Bible every time we proclaim the message of God’s love.       At home, we put up an altar where we can place our Bible. Place candles and flowers to decorate the room especially the place of enthronement.       Before reading the Bible, we pray to the Holy Spirit to help us understand the written Holy Words of God.       The Bible readings selected each day are found in the Missal or Lectionary which we use during the Holy Mass. This also needs our reverence because it also contains the Word of God. We need to listen attentively when the priest or someone proclaims God’s message to us because it is God Himself speaking to us.       We should not forget that Jesus loves us and He wants us to love Him more when we give respect or listen to the story about His life.       It is not easy to live the Word of God but we must follow the example of Jesus and try to practice it in our day to day life.","Enhancing our Faith  A. Write what you can remember.

We wtll respect our parents or other people when they read the Bible at home, or any places where the Word of God is proclaimed to everyone.       Let us think about the message of God as we listen to the stories related to us by our parents, teachers, and other people.       When we are asked to read the word of God, we must do it with love and reverence to give praise and worship to Him.","Celebrating our Faith       Let us thank God for His message of love in the Holy Bible. Let us pray together.  O God, we thank You for giving us Your written Holy Word in the Bible.       Thank You for sending us Jesus Christ and letting us know about His life through stories taken from the Bible.  Thank You for teaching us how to listen attentively to the Word of God.       Thank You for sending us the Holy Spirit to guide us to understand better Your great love for us. This, we ask in Jesus’ name. Amen.  Message from Marie Rivier  My dear children,       It is Jesus, through the words of his mouth, which revealed the truths                   of the Gospel and taught us the ways of salvation.","Lesson                The Prophets Told Us about                the Coming of Our Savior                  4  Expected Outcomes: a. To realize that God prepared the people before the coming of our       Savior b. To show faithfulness in obeying the people who represent God c. To pray and ask God to help us become obedient like the prophets  Life Situation                                 Mang Tenong and His Tenants  illus based on book       One day, Mang Tenong went to his farm. He called all his tenants for a meeting. Each tenant was asked to report how the farm was managed. The first tenant reported that he planted rice and corn in one  hectare of the land and got a good harvest. The second tenant also reported that he was able to get a good harvest of the vegetables he planted in another one hectare of the land. He sold the vegetables in the market and got enough money to pay for the expenses in the farm. While the third tenant did not give any report about the banana plantation he was managing because it was a failure. He always comes","late and did not follow the correct schedule for the working men to report in the field.","Mang Tenong was grateful to his two tenants for the good harvests. However, for the third tenant, Mang Tenong was not happy with him but he did not get angry, instead, he advised him how to improve his work in the farm. Though the third tenant was not successful but he was given a chance to continue managing the banana plantation and follow the right procedure in taking care of the farm.","Value Development       You have read the short story about the tenants of Mang Tenong, who worked in his farm. His attitude towards the tenants as he interviewed them was full of love, consideration, patience and understanding.  What was the report of the first tenant?  How about the second tenant?  What can you say about the third tenant?       How did Mang Tenong feel when there was no report from the third tenant?  Did Mang Tenong get angry for the failures of this man?       If you are in the place of the third tenant what will you do to improve your farm?       We should also be like Mang Tenong. We will be considerate to our workers and give them chance to improve. Let us also continue to be good to those whom we entrust our resources.       This short story is somewhat similar to what had happened to the people in the Bible, when they were called by God to do great mission.       Let us try to practice doing difficult things which demand self-sacrifice and be patient to do them cheerfully and willingly. That is what God wants us to do. As people of God, we are called to obey Him.","Proclamation of the Word of God       Jesus then went on to say to those Jews who believed in him: “If you live according to my teaching, you are truly my disciples; then, you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” “We are descendants of Abraham” was their answer. “Never have we been the slaves of anyone. What do you mean, by saying you will be free?” Jesus replied.       “I tell you my assurance; everyone who lives in sin is the slave of sin. No slave has a permanent place in the family, but his son has a place there forever. That is why, if the son frees you, you will really be free. I realized you are one of Abraham’s stocks. Nonetheless, you are trying to kill me because my word finds no hearing among you. I tell you what I have seen in the Father’s presence; you do what you have heard from your father.” They retorted, “Our Father is Abraham.” Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham’s children, you would be following Abraham’s example. The fact is you are trying to kill me, a man who has told you the truth which I have heard from God. Abraham did nothing like that. Indeed you are doing your father’s works.” They cried, “We are no legitimate breed! We have but one father and that is God himself.” Jesus answered: Were God, your Father, you would love me, for I came forth from God, and am here. I did not come of my own will; it was he who sent me.                                                                                                        John 8: 31 – 42","Knowing our Faith       Man and woman, Adam and Eve were created by God in His own image and likeness and put them in-charge of the Garden of Eden. But they were not faithful to God, instead they disobeyed Him and committed sin. Nevertheless, God was not angry and did not leave them alone but made a promise to send a Savior. The promise began with Abraham. God chose Abraham to be the Father of the Chosen People. God was faithful with His promise. He even let the following prophets of old testament announce to the people the coming of the messiah: Abraham and the next generation in the Old Testament; like Isaac, Moses, Jacob, and David. They foretold that the messiah who will be born will endure many hardships but He will obey God by keeping God’s words and doing what is right.","Challenges of our Faith       God watches His Chosen People carefully. God also watches over us. He wants us to do good things and not bad things. If we commit sins we become the slaves of the devil. Those men whom God chose were very faithful to Him. They were ready to do anything God wanted them to do.       Sometimes, when we are asked to do a very difficult work we say, “I couldn’t do that”, even if we have not tried doing the task given to us. We must show our faithfulness and obedience to God by doing our work with love through our parents and members of our family, our teachers and friends, and all the people around us. We must ask help from God when we work at home or study our lessons because it is difficult to do them by ourselves. We are assured that the Holy Spirit is always at our side and will guide us all the time. God will surely send us someone who will enlighten our hearts and minds. We should also listen to those people who represent God and we must do what they asked us to do.","Enhancing our Faith       Complete the sentences below.

Let us obey our parents, teachers, aunts, uncles, older brothers, and sisters and be always ready to ask help from them to do things right.      Moses showed his faith and trust in God. Later, he became the leader of the Hebrews. We also show our trust to God like him. God is always with us and provides us food, clothing and shelter. We must be faithful to God by thanking Him through prayers.","Celebrating our Faith       Let us thank God for His gifts to us; for faith, hope, and love. Let us pray together: An Act of Faith.       “O my God, I firmly believe that You are one God in three Divine Persons: the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit. I believe that Your Divine Son became man and died for our sins and that He will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe these and all the truths which the Holy Catholic Church teaches us because You have revealed them, who can neither deceive or be deceived.”  Let us sing together:  1. Father, we adore You. Lay our lives before You.      How we love You.  2. Jesus, we adore You. Lay our lives before You.      How we love you.  3. Spirit, we adore You. Lay our lives before You.      How we love You.  4.

To tell that Jesus reveals to us His Father’s love b. To strengthen our faith and trust in God c. To rely on God by praying and asking Him to provide us what we need  Life Situation                                           A Story For You      Lilanie, a grade four pupil was asked by her teacher to give a summary of the short story that she read from her English textbook. The story goes like this.","Once            there was a                 in a palace King who lived  Queen who                 care of their with      his   royal family                 together in took good       As the only                 kingdom, the only son. The                          Queen lived happily   their son to  the kingdom.             strong,                 and loving heir to the  King      and  prepared  become  courageous,  man.       After many years, the son of the King and Queen grew into a responsible man. Prince Chiquito, as he was called, took charge of the Kingdom before the King and Queen died.       While ruling the kingdom, Prince Chiquito never forgets his parents. The example of his parents especially his father made a deep impression to the Prince. That’s why, he wanted to let his men know about is father who was known to be a charitable King. So, he brought his men in the palace and showed to them the accomplishment of his father. He told them the story on how his father managed their Kingdom. He also shared to his men what the many good things he learned from the Queen, his mother.       The inhabitants of the Kingdom regarded Prince Chiquito as kind, honest and generous Prince just like the King. He told his men to follow their example and treat everyone in the Kingdom with love. Prince Chiquito lived a simple life style. He continued to use the wealth of the Kingdom to improve the condition of the people. Through his example, the goodness of the King and Queen was always remembered and he led the people to be also kind to others.","Value Development       We want to be happy at home. We show our love to our father and mother by obeying them. Everyday we try to help and do the work assigned to us cheerfully and with care.       We remember our parents who taught us through their examples how to do good things.       In appreciation of the many good things we learned from our parents and we honor them by also doing good to others. We are proud of our parents especially our father who provide us what we need together with our mother who took care of us.       Like the story of Prince Chiquito, we are reminded of the good example our parents have shown to us.  Who are the members of the Royal Family?  Describe how they live in the Palace.       What attitude of the King he wanted his son Prince Chiquito to emulate or follow?       How did Prince Chiquito put into action what he learned from his father?       What does Prince Chiquito want his men to always remember about his father and mother?       How about you? Can you relate other stories wherein a son revealed the goodness of his father?       Do you also want to know stories from the Bible of how Jesus taught us about his Father?","Proclamation of the Word of God       Jesus said to his disciples, that is why I am telling you not to worry about your life and what you are to eat nor about your body and how you are to clothe it. For life means more than food, and the body more than clothing. Think of the ravens. They do not sow or reap; they have no store houses and no barns; yet God feeds them. And how much more are you worth than the birds! Can any of you, for all his worrying, add a single cubit to his span of life? Therefore, If the smallest things, are outside your control, why worry about the rest? Think of the flowers; they never have to spin or weave; yet I assure you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of them. Now if that is how God clothes the grass in the field which is there today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow, how much more will he looks after you, you men of little faith! But you, you must not set your hearts in things to last and things to drink; nor must you worry. It is the pagans of this world who set their hearts in all these things. Your Father will know you need them. No; set your hearts on his kingdom, and these other things will be given you as well.       There is no need to be afraid, little flock; it has pleased your Father to give you the Kingdom.                                                                                                       Luke 12: 22 – 32","What did Jesus say to his disciples?  What do you mean when Jesus said, “Do not worry about all what you need in life?”  Knowing our Faith       Jesus used examples from nature to teach us about His Father’s love. We see the beautiful things in nature that remind us of God.       God our Father provides us with all the important things that we need.       Jesus was strong, courageous, and loving and He inspired others to have confidence and love to His Father.       Jesus teaches us that God wants us to put our faith and trust in Him. God will give us all we need to live. Jesus wants us to lift up our eyes and look at the birds and other animals. God provides for them. Jesus tells us that we will not be concerned so much with our life, like what to eat or what to wear for our body. Life is more important than food and the body is more important than clothing.       Jesus walked into the temple where He usually talked to the people about His Father. When He got inside He was shocked at what He saw. The people made the temple into a market place. There were money- changers who gave a high rate in exchange to the local money and some vendors selling animals to be sacrificed in a high amount, too. It showed that they were cheating especially the poor.       Jesus was very angry. He could not believe what the people did. So, He drove out the people, threw the crates of doves out of the door and said, Scripture has it, “My house shall be called a house of prayer.” All the vendors left the temple and Jesus went into the temple to pray to His Father. The blind, lame and other sick people came into the temple to see Jesus.","Challenges of our Faith       Let us try to focus more on to what is essential and to what concerns the Kingdom of God. What concerns our body is just passing but what concerns the Kingdom of God is lasting. Let us therefore, give honor and glory to God, the source of who we are and what we are.       We only ask our parents for the things we need either for our personal use at home, in school, and in the church.       We believe that God is a provider. First and foremost, He gives us life. He will provide us with what we need as long as we ask it in faith and trust. He will give us what we ask; provided, it is good for us and we know how to wait in His own time.       We also appreciate what Jesus did in the temple, His Father’s house. We learned that Jesus as one hundred percent human knows how to get angry but in a proper time. This happened, when He expressed His disappointment by driving out the vendors who made the temple, His Father’s house a market place. But people misjudged Him and expressed false and harsh opinions against Him. Nevertheless, Jesus was not afraid even if He was misunderstood by others. As Jesus’ follower, we should imitate Him and not to be afraid to stand for what is right.  Enhancing our Faith  A.

They were all boys namely Meo, Nido, and Rico.","One day, Mrs. Carreon went to their GKK for a meeting and she was chosen as the in-charge of preparation for their patronal fiesta in honor of San Isidro Labrador, the patron saint of the farmers.       In the evening after supper the family gathered together in the sala. Mr. Carreon, being head of the family, shared his plans for the incoming fiesta celebration. He made a list of shared responsibilities which includes his three children. Meo was assigned to clean their surroundings. Nido will help his mother to plan for the menu and other food preparation. Rico being the youngest of the family was tasked to prepare the tables and chairs for the visitors. Mr. Carreon worked hand-in-hand with his wife preparing the utensils and supervised the whole affair.       During the preparation, the family of Mr. and Mrs. Carreon showed love and unity.

In what way can you say that they are of one mind and heart? In your own opinion, would their love and unity continue to grow even after the fiesta celebration?       We all believe that God has created us and gave us everything we need. It is in our home that we experience love, unity, and cooperation. It is also in our home that we experience great joy being together as a family, helping one another and making others happy. When there is joy, love, peace, and unity at home, in school or in the church, we are sharing the life of the Blessed Trinity.       When we gather together as one family of God in our GKK celebrating the feast of our patron saint, we are living the life of the Blessed Trinity. The Blessed Trinity, the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, though they are three, they are of one mind and heart.       How wonderful to see many people around us loving and praising God.

John tried to refuse Him with a protest, “I should be baptized by You, yet You come to me!” Jesus answered: “Give in for now. We must do this if we would fulfill all of God’s demands.” So John gave in. After Jesus was baptized, He came directly out of the water.  Suddenly, the sky opened and He saw the Spirit of God descend like a dove and hover over Him. With that, a voice from heavens said, “This is my beloved Son. My favor rests on Him.”                                                                                                  Matthew 3: 13 – 17","Knowing our Faith       Christian life is all about relationships. We Christians believe that there is only one God but in three Divine Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and we call them the Blessed Trinity. These three share infinitely happy relationships with one another and desire to share their happiness with us.       God the Father is the first Person of the Blessed Trinity. The work of creation is attributed to God the Father. The God the Son is the second Person of the Blessed Trinity. To God the Son, we owe our redemption from sin and eternal damnation; by His passion, death and resurrection He gave us eternal life. God the Holy Spirit is the third Person of the Blessed Trinity. He manifests Himself in us particularly in our sanctification. He comes to live in us making us holy, strong, and brave.       God the Father, seeing His own Image in the Son, loves the Son; and God the Son loves the Father from all eternity. Each loves the other, because each sees in the other the infinity of the God head, the beauty of Divinity, the Supreme Truth of God. The two Persons loving each other do not just have a thought, as human beings would have, but from their mutual love is breathed forth like, a Living Person one with them, and of their own substance. This is God the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Love, who proceeds from the Father and the Son.       The Blessed Trinity is a wonderful mystery; a mystery which we cannot fully understand through our intellect. But through our faith, we believe the oneness of the three Divine persons in the Blessed Trinity. The Blessed Trinity lives in each baptized Christians.","Challenges of our Faith       At our Baptism, God the Holy Spirit purifies us from all sins and fills our souls with divine grace so that we become truly children of God, sons and daughters and heirs to the Kingdom of God. Through Baptism we become living temples of the Holy Spirit. Wherever we are, let us bear in mind that we give glory to God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Let us keep our souls free from sin because this is the sanctuary of the Holy Spirit and the dwelling place of God.       In the mystery of the Blessed Trinity, God the Father, as being promised in the Old Testament, became man in the person of Jesus Christ His Son. The Son, Jesus Christ became like us in all things except sin. He lived among us, suffered, was crucified and died to set us free from all our sins. After three days, Jesus rose from death to tell us that death has no more power over us. After forty days, Jesus went back to His Father in heaven. In order not to leave us orphan, Jesus Christ sends the Holy Spirit to be with us all the time forever.       The three Persons in one God are of the same nature. We cannot fully comprehend this but here are some analogies to help us understand the Blessed Trinity. Let us consider a mango fruit. The mango has peeling, flesh, and the seed but it is all in one mango fruit. Just like an electric fan which has three blades but once it is put on we can only see one blade. So, the three persons in the Blessed Trinity is one God, but with different role to play in the world.       The Blessed Trinity was manifested during the Baptism of Jesus Christ at the river Jordan. God the Holy Spirit came down in visible form, in the form of a dove and God the Father spoke from the heavens; saying: “This is my beloved son. My favor rests on him.” (Mt. 2:17)       The Blessed Trinity is also manifested in the family; father, mother and children loving each other.","Enhancing our Faith       The feast of the Blessed Trinity, called Trinity Sunday, is celebrated on the first Sunday after Pentecost.       All the sacraments are administered in the name of the Blessed Trinity.       We give praise, honor, and adoration to the Blessed Trinity every time we say the doxology or “prayer of praise.”       “Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it      was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be world without end.”      Amen.  Give at least three reasons why we pray the “Glory Be”.  1.  2.  3.  Living our Faith       We always make the sign of the cross to bless ourselves, to ask for blessing from God, and to express our faith in one God.       We invoke the name of the Blessed Trinity when we start and end our prayer.       We make the sign of the cross before going to bed and when we wake up in the morning to ask God to bless our day.","Celebrating our Faith  Let us express our faith in the Holy Triune God by praying the following prayer.  Let us pray:  * In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.  * I believe in God the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth,      and in Jesus Christ His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the      Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate was      crucified, died, and was buried; He descended into hell; on the third      day, He rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven; and is      seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; I believe in the      Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the      forgiveness of our sins, the resurrection of the body, and life      everlasting.

The oldest among their children are twins, Catherine and Therese. They are eight years old, just starting third grade. Bernadette is six and just starting first grade. Jonathan is three and Baby Joey is one year old.       On Mother’s day, their Mama received cards and love letters from her friends and family. She received presents, hugs and kisses, and good wishes. All these things mean a lot to her. She noticed and felt the love of her family and friends. Many loved her. Their father and the siblings were able to say, “We love you, mother.” Other people gave her material things in appreciation and gratitude of her kindness.","","Value Development       This little story tells us how to express our love to the members of our family.

This is how we know that we love God’s children: it is by loving God and obeying his commands. For our love for God means that we obey his commands. His commands are not too hard for us, because every child of God is able to defeat the world. And we win the victory over the world by means of our faith. Who can defeat the world? Only the person who believes that Jesus is the son of God.  Jesus Christ is the one who came with the water of his baptism and  the blood of death. He came not only with the water, but with both  the water and the blood. And the Spirit himself testifies that this is true,  because the Spirit is truth…. So all who believe in the Son of God  have this testimony in their own hearts but those who do not believe  God have  made him                                          out  to be a liar  because                                           they  have not  believed  what God                                          has  said about                                        his  Son….  Whoever                                           has  the Son has                                       this  life; whoever  does not have the Son of God does not have life.                                                    John 5: 1 – 12","Knowing our Faith       God is eternal. He has no beginning and no end. He always was and always will be and that He always remains the same. There is no time with God. With Him there is neither past nor future; everything is present. We cannot imagine eternity, but we can understand what it is to be without beginning or end.       God is our Father. He created us in His perfect love according to His own plan. He gives us everything with love. We praise and thank our God when we see the wonders of His creation.       We believe that God loves each one of us. He is the creator and our loving Father. He is perfect in all things and can do everything around us.       God is the essence of all good, the fountainhead of all perfection. In Him is to be found all that is good. He is infinite in power, wisdom, love, mercy, and justice. He is present everywhere. He is the perfect Creator and Ruler of the universe, the heaven and the earth. He governs and directs the universe through His perfect plan.","Challenges of our Faith       We know God is our Father. He made us His children so we can live with Him in heaven. We always think how God loves us and how He cares for us. If we realize that God is our eternal Father, we always think that He gave us everything with love. When we look at each of His creations, we see God and realize that He made everything in this world with love.       Therefore, we also love God in return by taking care of everything that He has created for us. Just as our Papa who wants us to act in such a way that he is proud of us, so, does our Heavenly Father expect us to act as His children. We show to our Heavenly Father that we are glad to be in His care and to have Him watch over us with love by doing what pleases Him. We try to use all the gifts He has given us in the best way possible. We try to treat others kindly because they belong to Him. God loves all of His people and His children.","Enhancing our Faith  God is always was and always will be.      God is eternal. He existed before anything could be created.

Let us make a habit to read the Bible at home especially the story of creation. Let us also share what we read in the Bible to the members of our family.       We learned that God made us and direct our lives so we must submit to His Holy will by obeying our parents, teachers, and those who represent Him in the Church like; the Pope, Bishops, and Priests.       How could we express our gratitude to God for the wonders of His being? It is through adoring, praising, and thanking Him at the celebration of the Holy Eucharist. Let us not miss to celebrate the Holy Mass on Sundays because this is the highest form of prayer that we can offer to God.  Celebrating our Faith  When we pray, we express our faith, hope, and love in God.  Let us now recall how God loves us and let us thank Him for the many blessings we received.

She also asked each  student to stand and briefly introduce their name, where they come from and any interests they enjoy. The first pupil sitting in front of the row came forward and introduced herself to the class. She was a transferee student. She said; “My name is Reyna Santos from Hinatuan, Surigao. My parents and other members of the family used to call me Inday since I am the youngest of the family. But my friends and neighbors call me Rein or Ren-ren. My interest in life is swimming and playing the piano.” Another pupil came forward and introduced himself in this way. “During my baptism, I was given a name Vincent by my parents in honor of our patron saint San Vicente Ferrer. At home they call me Boboy. But my","friends and neighbors call me Vin, or Cen-cen. My hobbies are playing basketball, helping my father in the farm, and cooking. I live in one of the barrios not far from here.”","Two pupils came forward and also introduced themselves. They were twins. The one with a headband introduced her sister in this manner. “My sister’s name is Carla Mae while I am Sheila Mae. Though we are twins, we have different likes in life. She loves singing while I love dancing. At home we are called Carla and Sheila while our neighbors and friends call us Kambal. Our home is just one block away from this school. The other grade four pupils also came forward and introduced themselves. After the activity, the teacher gave them assignment for the following day.","Value Development       During our baptism, we received our name. The name given is only the first of several names a person will bear throughout life. The truth is that names are a part of every culture and that they are of enormous importance both to the people who receive names and to the societies that given them. Sometimes, children get their names from the family trees of their parents or from the name of Saints. Regardless of why we have such a name, the giving and receiving of a name is an event of major importance.       Aside from our real names, we also have nicknames. Only people whom we have intimate relationship will call us such a name. Like the one in the story. What were the names of the pupils of Miss Celine Castro? How were they called by their parents, friends, and neighbors?       For the Israelites where Jesus belongs, a name is significant in forming the person’s identity. It carried a spiritual significance. Like Jesus, His name has a lot to do with His mission. He also has a lot of titles. In the Bible, specifically in the New Testament, we can find the many titles of Jesus.  Art It Out If you are asked to introduce yourself, how would you do it?

They named him Wonderful-Counselor, God-Hero, Father-Forever, Prince of Peace. His dominion is vast and forever peaceful. From David’s throne, and over his kingdom, which he confirms and sustains by judgment and justice, both now and forever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.                                                  Isaiah 9:5-6  Color the names of SOMEONE given to us by God.      WONDERFUL     COUNSELOR PRINCE OF PEACE      FATHER - FOREVER            GOD - HERO  Who is He?","Knowing our Faith       Our Lord Jesus Christ is true God and true man. As God, He is equal with the Father and the Holy Spirit. As man, He has a body and soul like us.       Jesus Christ has two natures which are distinct and cannot be separated: the human and the divine. This means that Jesus Christ is one hundred percent human because He was born through Mary who is a human being like us. He is also one hundred percent divine because it was through the Holy Spirit that He was conceived. Though He has two natures; He is one Person.       It was to the Blessed Virgin Mary that the Archangel Gabriel announced: “You shall conceive and bear a son, and give Him the name Jesus. Great will be His dignity and He will be called Son of the Most High. (Luke 1:31-32)”       Therefore, Jesus Christ is both God and man. With His human nature Jesus worked, ate, got hungry, and felt pain but He has no sin at all. It was His divine nature that enabled Him to be transfigured, walk on water, and raise the dead to life.       The name Jesus means “Savior or Redeemer.” He is called Jesus because He came to save us from sin, and to open the doors of heaven for us.       Christ is another title of Jesus which come from the ancient Greek word “Christos” which means, “The Anointed One or the Messiah.” We are called Christians because we are Disciples of Jesus Christ. We believe in his teaching and obey his commandments.       Except the name Jesus Christ, He has also different titles like in the Old Testament: Wonderful-Counselor, God-Hero, Father-Forever, and Prince of Peace. In the New Testament, He is sometimes called: Lord, Light of the World, Son of God, Son of Man, the Alpha and the Omega, Emmanuel, Bread of Life, and many more.       We also call Him, “Our Lord and Savior” because as God He is Lord and Master of all, and as our Savior He redeemed us from our sins with His death on the cross. Although, Jesus Christ has many titles, He is one person.","Challenges of our Faith       We just learned the meaning of the name - Jesus Christ and we also discovered some of the different titles of Jesus Christ which describe Him and his mission of coming to earth. In the Gospel of Mark (8:27-30) Jesus explicitly asked His apostles “Who do people say that I am? The disciples began talking about the various opinions people had about the identity of Jesus. But Jesus was not contented of their answers. He asked them again. “Who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You are the Messiah.”       What if Jesus will suddenly appear into our midst and ask also this question; “Who do you say that I am?” What would be your answer? Do you really know who Jesus is? Do you also have another title of Jesus Christ? Jesus wants an answer that is really coming from our heart. Through our faith, we know that Jesus is the Son of God who came into the world to be like us in all things except sin. He is also Son of Man because He lives with us and died for the love of us. No matter what happens, Jesus wants us to keep on believing in Him. If we do, we shall grow in great love of Him.  Enhancing our Faith  A. Color the letters of your choice. Use your favorite color.    JESUS IS THE SON OF    GOD.    I believe in him.","B. Write your own title of Jesus Christ. Tell something about your title.  Living our Faith       We believe in the person and mission of Jesus Christ. In the four Gospels, the Evangelists mentioned that Jesus came to heal people from the different kinds of sickness which are caused by sin. He healed not only those who were physically sick but also the spiritually ill, like those possessed by evil spirits.       Following the example of Jesus Christ, let us also show concern to the sick people. We will visit and extend our help and support to them. We will also pray for their recovery.       When we go home after the class, let us be the one to serve the sick member in the family. Let us also help our mother to care for our younger brother or sister.  Celebrating our Faith  Let us express our faith in Jesus through prayer:       Dear Jesus, we love you and we hope in you. Teach us to be like you. Make our faith strong and courageous. We believe that everything that happens to us today is according to your will. We offer this day for our brothers and sisters who are suffering.","Let us fix our eyes at Jesus on the crucifix and together we say, “Jesus I love you.

Suddenly, from up in the sky there came a noise like a strong, driving wind which was heard all through the house where they were seated. Tongues of fire appeared which parted and came to rest on each of them. All were filled with the Holy Spirit. They began to express themselves in foreign tongues and make bold proclamations as the Spirit prompted them.       Staying in Jerusalem at the time were devout Jews of every nation under heaven. They heard the sound, and assembled in a large crowd. They were much confused because each one heard these men speaking in his own language. The whole occurrence astonished them. They asked in utter amazement, “Are not all of these men who are speaking Galileans? How is it that each of us hears them in his native tongue? We are Parthians, Medes, and Elamites. We live in Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus, the province of Asia, Phyrgia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the regions of Libya around Cyrene. There are even visitors from Rome - all Jews, or those who have come over the Judaism; Cretans and Arabs too. Yet each of us hears them speaking in his own tongue about the marvels of God has accomplished.”                                                                                                          Acts 2: 1 – 11","","Knowing our Faith       The Holy Spirit is a person equal in every way with God the Father and God the Son. He is the third person in the Blessed Trinity. Jesus said He would send the Spirit to us to be our Helper, Comforter, and Guide. “And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever” (John 14:16). Jesus gave the Spirit as a “compensation” for His absence, to perform the functions toward us which He would have done if He had remained personally with us.       On certain occasions the Holy Spirit appeared in visible form. When Jesus Christ was baptized by John the Baptist, the Holy Spirit appeared in a form of a dove. On Pentecost day, the Holy Spirit came in a mighty rushing wind which was heard all throughout the house where all were gathered. Tongues of fire appeared and came to rest in each one of them. These signs are symbolic of the action of the Holy Spirit. The form of a dove symbolizes the gentleness with which the Holy Spirit works in our souls. The rush winds symbolize the strengthening of our will. The fire symbolizes zeal, fervor, and illumination of the mind.       The Holy Spirit is the soul of the Church, the body of Christ. The Holy Spirit directs the Church in all of her actions with the end goal of proclaiming and firmly establishing the promised Kingdom of God on earth as it is in Heaven.       On Pentecost day, many were converted because the Apostles had the “gift of tongues.” This means that the Apostles spoke in their own language, but the foreigners who listened to them heard in their own native tongues and understood the message.       We celebrate the descent of the Holy Spirit every Pentecost Sunday, fifty days after Easter wherein He came down upon the disciples and remain with them forever (cf. Jn 14:16). This is the birthday of the Church because the Church was publicly displayed to the multitude; the Gospel began to spread among the nations by means of preaching. The Holy Spirit watches over the people of God, protecting them from destruction until the end of time.","Challenges of our Faith       The Holy Spirit “bears witness” to Christ (cf. Jn 15:26) and this witness pervades the heart and soul of those who participate in Pentacost. They in turn become witnesses and proclaimers of the message. The “tongues of fire” (Acts 2:3), which appeared over the head of each one present, are the external sign of the enthusiasm enkindled in them by the Holy Spirit. The apostles extended this enthusiasm to their listeners, which already happened after Peter’s discourse on the first day.       Many times we plan to do good; this is the work of the Holy Spirit. When we actually put our good plans into practice and cooperate with His grace, the Holy Spirit continues His work in the Church through us. The Holy Spirit guides and enlightens us in every decision we will make. Sometimes, He comes through our parents, teachers or friends who instruct us what to do for our own good and for the good of others. But if we are selfish and do not listen to the people who comes our way, then something bad will happen to us. Many people get involved in crimes or addiction because they do not listen to the Holy Spirit.       We believe that the Holy Spirit continues to pour out His abundant graces upon us when we invoke His presence. We should be grateful to Jesus for sending us His Holy Spirit to be with us all the time. Let us not forget to always ask the guidance of the Holy Spirit in whatever we say and do. Let us also be a guide for others bringing them closer to Jesus and Mary.","Enhancing our Faith       There are 7 Gifts of the Holy Spirit which are: wisdom, understanding, counsel, knowledge, fortitude, piety, and fear of the Lord.

We too can be Christ witnesses in our own little way.       Later, when you are be confirmed, the Holy Spirit will come and make you His witnesses and you will also receive the gifts and fruits of the Holy Spirit which will make you strong and courageous child of God.  Celebrating our Faith       Let us always remember to pray and ask the Holy Spirit to come and give us His fruits of love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Let us often pray this prayer:       “Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of Your faithful and enkindle in them      the fire of Your love. Send forth Your Spirit, and they shall be created;      and You shall renew the face of the earth.”  Let us pray       O God, who teaches the hearts of Your faithful by the light of the Holy Spirit, grant us by the same Spirit to have right judgment in all things and forever to rejoice in His holy comfort.

It was in  one Spirit that all of us whether Jew or Greek, slave or free, were  baptized into one body. All of us have been given to drink of the one  Spirit. Now the body is not one member, it is many. If the foot should  say, “because I am not a hand I do not belong to the body,” would it  then no longer belong body? “Because I am not the eye I do not  belong to the body,” would it then be no longer belong to the body?  If your whole body were all eye, what would happen to our hearing?  If it were all ear, what would happen to our smelling?         As it is, God has set each member of the body in the place he  wanted it to be. If all the members were alike, where would the body  be? There are indeed many different members, but one body. The  eye cannot say to the hand, “I do not need you,” any more than the  head can say to the feet, “I do not need you.” Even those members  of the body which seem less important are in fact indispensable……         You, then, are one body of Christ. Every one of you is a member  of it. Furthermore, God has set up in the church first apostles, second  prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, healers, assistants,  administrators, and those who speak in tongues.                                                                                                             Acts 2: 1 – 11  What are the different parts of the human body created by God?  How do you compare each part to Christ’s body, the Church?","Knowing our Faith       Jesus Christ founded the Church to continue His mission here on earth. The word Church comes from the Latin word Ekklesia, which means “the people of God called together (CFC #1355).” In other words, the Church is a congregation of all baptized persons united in the same faith, the same sacrifice, and the same sacraments, under the authority of the Sovereign Pontiff or the Pope and the bishops in communion with him (My Catholic Faith pg. 94). It is an assembly of those who through faith and Baptism have become children of God, members of Christ, and temples of the Holy Spirit (CCC #147).       He chose twelve called “Apostles” whom he gave a special mission to teach, to sanctify, and to rule His Church. St. Peter was the first visible Head or the first Pope of the Church. He is also the first bishop of Rome. The other eleven apostles work with St. Peter by preaching the Good News to other places outside Jerusalem. The Bishops help the Pope. The priests help the bishops in taking care of God’s people.       Jesus did not leave the Church alone forever but He promise to remain for all time in the Church. “…And know that I am with you always, until the end of the world (Mt. 28:20).       The mission of the Church is to proclaim and establish the Kingdom of God begun by Jesus Christ among all peoples. The Church must teach, otherwise men would not know the truth. The Church must sanctify, bringing grace, otherwise men could not be saved. And the Church must rule, because Christ founded it as a society, which must have authority (My Catholic Faith).  Challenges of our Faith       As members of the Church, we are challenged to spread the Good News to others in school, at home, and in the ordinary things we do everyday through our example. We ask help from God to give us the grace to guide us on how to reach out to others especially to those who are in need. Let us also pray for the leaders of the Church especially our Pope, our Bishops, and priests.","It is also our responsibility to give alms and give financial or any forms of support to our Church. Everyday, our mother gives us a certain amount for our merienda. Let us make little sacrifice by keeping a small amount from our “baon” to help other suffering members of our Church.       It is not always easy to be faithful to Christ but if we value His love for us, we must follow His example especially His love for the poor.  Enhancing our Faith  A.

As a Church we must participate in the celebration of the Holy Eucharist on Sunday, the Lord’s Day. It is a special day to worship God as one people. Sunday is the time we can also meet other members of the Church where we belong. We will also meet our priest who shepherds the people in our own parish.       As a Church we help one another to promote peace and love at home, in school, and in the community where we belong.","We also pray for the mission of the Church and especially for our Pope who shepherds God’s people here on earth.  Celebrating our Faith  I. In silence, let us pray for our brothers and sisters who are victims of the      different natural or man-made calamities and ask the Father to send      generous people to help them.      (Pause for silent reflections ---- then pray the “Our Father”)  II. Write a “Prayer of Thanksgiving” in gratitude for the gift of Jesus who      founded the Church and for all the shepherds or leaders of God’s      people.  III. You may share your “Prayer of Thanksgiving” while others pray in      silence.  IV. Let us sing a Thanksgiving Hymn:       Thank you, Lord, for giving me my life that I might serve you.      Thank you, Lord, for giving me my voice that I might praise you. Thank      you, Lord, for giving me my heart that I might love you.

They teach us many things to prepare us for the future. Our mothers know us best more than other persons. They take care, love, protect, and nurture us. They also nurture the relationships within the family. Some mothers sacrifice to work in far places to provide good future for their children but “what matters is that a mother loves her children deeply.” In keeping with the devotion for God and her husband, she prioritizes them above all else.” Mothers always think of their children. As children, we should imitate the example of our mothers.       How do you show your love to your mother?       What will you do when your mother ask you to do something?

Proclamation of the Word of God          The Wedding at Cana.          Three days later, there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee. The   mother of Jesus was there. Jesus and His disciples had also been   invited. When they ran out of wine, since the wine provided for the   wedding was all finished, the mother of Jesus said to him. “They have   no wine,” Jesus said, “Woman, why turn to me?” My hour has not   come yet, His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever He tells you.”   There were six stone water jars standing there, meant for the ablutions,   that are customary among the Jews; each could hold twenty or thirty   gallons. Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water” and they   filled them to the brim. “Draw some out now,” He told them and take   it to the steward. They did this; the steward tasted the water, and it   had turned into wine. Having no idea where it came from - only the   servants who had drawn the water know – the steward called the   bridegroom and said, “People generally serve the best wine first and   keep the cheaper","sort till the guests have had plenty to drink; but you have kept the best wine till now. This was the first of the signs given by Jesus: it was performed at Cana in Galilee.                                                   John 2: 1 – 11  What occasion took place in Cana Galilee?  Who were with Jesus during the wedding at Cana?  What important event happened at the wedding?  How did Mary play her role as a Mother?  Knowing our Faith       Mary, the physical mother of Jesus our Savior, becomes the mother of us all in the order of grace…(CFC #517). She is also the mother of the Church in the order of grace because she gave birth to Jesus, the Son of God, and the head of the body which is the Church (Compedium of CCC #196).       At the wedding of Cana, Mary’s request prompted Jesus to perform his first miracle of changing the water into wine. Mary’s great faith to her Son, already assumed her future role as sharing her Son’s saving mission (adapted from CFC #516).       Mary, therefore, had a unique mission from God to be the Mother of His Son made-man, the Redeemer, and to share in His son’s salvific mission (CCC #523). From this mission, God had given Mary a singular grace and privilege of the Immaculate Conception. This means that Mary “from the first moment of her conception was preserved from the stain of original sin”. This was to prepare Mary of her incoming mission of becoming the mother of the Son of God (adapted CFC #523).","Since Mary is the mother of Jesus, and the mother of us all, Jesus is our Brother. Mary is closely connected with Christ in His work of salvation. As a mother, Mary is interested in all her children like us. She teaches them and helps them to grow in holiness and in God’s love. She always shows them Jesus, and tells them to imitate Him and to be like Him.  Challenges of our Faith       Since Mary is our Mother, we must be obedient children. Just like Jesus who was obedient to her and to Joseph. Mary wants us to grow in God’s love like her son, Jesus. She always gives us the example of perfect obedience. Therefore, as her children, we must be obedient not only to our parents but also to our elder brothers and sisters, teachers and those who are in authority.       Mary is a mother of a big family. She wants us to love one another as she loves each one of us, her children.       We give her homage on her feast days. We pray and offer flowers as a sign of our great love for her not only if we are in need but everyday. We must be sincere and true to our words when we pray to Mary. We will not only pray for ourselves but let us also ask Mama Mary’s intercession for all those who suffer physically, emotionally and psychologically.       Let us live according to the example of Mama Mary especially her virtue of purity and obedience to God’s Holy Will.       We must remind one another that as Catholic, we should honor Mama Mary by praying the Holy Rosary everyday at home, in school or in our community gathering (GKK).","Write the mysteries in the life of Jesus and Mary:  a.

So,  they took up a position much farther away and said to Moses, “You  speak to us and we will listen, but let not God speak to us, or we shall  die.” Moses answered the people, “do not be afraid, for God has  come to you only to test you, and put his fear upon you lest you should  sin.” Still the people remained at a distance, while Moses  approached the cloud where God was.                                                                                  Adapted from Exodus 20: 1 – 21  1. You shall not have other gods besides me. 2. You shall not take the name of the Lord, your God, in vain 3. Remember to keep holy the Lord’s Day 4. Honor your father and your mother. 5. You shall not kill. 6. You shall not commit adultery. 7. You shall not steal. 8. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. 9. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife,","10. You shall not covet anything that belongs to your neighbor. What are the laws given by God to Moses? Why did Moses tell the people not to be afraid of God?","Knowing our Faith       The primary purpose of the Commandments or Decalogue or the laws is to restore relationship between God (1-3) and sinful man and establish the foundation for relationship with one another (4-10). The commandments are like signposts, guiding us on the road as we journey. Without such understanding, the Ten Commandments are merely a set of rules that lead to death, discouragement, and pride (GodsTenLaws.com).       We are obliged to obey the commandments of God. We should gladly keep the commandments because God wishes and orders us to do so. It is the way to serve Him. If we keep the commandments, we can show that we love God.       Those who are obedient to God’s commandments always enjoy peace of conscience in this life, and in the next life. Their heavenly reward will be great, without limit and without end.       God loves us and wants us to know Him, to love Him, to serve Him and to be with Him. He wants us to obey Him in love. He made His commandments or laws out of love for us. These are our Heavenly Father’s rules for His great family on earth. They will help us to follow the right direction towards God and finally attain heaven to be with Him forever.       When Jesus came, He summarized the Ten Commandments into Two great commandments which are:       1) love God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind (1-3), and 2) love our neighbor as ourselves.","Challenges of our Faith       If we truly love our parents and friends, we do not wait to be commanded on what to do in order to please them. We can show God that we love Him that we want to serve Him by doing our work well. When we work, we should do it willingly and with joy. When we give the best in everything we do, we do not only please our parents or other people but God. We must be doing something rather than nothing. We should not be lazy or idle.       We should not only be satisfied keeping the commandments of God but we should always do good deeds even when we are not told.       In the life of Abraham, God tried his faith by telling him to sacrifice his only beloved son, Isaac. In perfect obedience, Abraham followed God’s command without doubt or hesitation. Just as Abraham raised the knife to slay his son, the angel of the Lord called out to Abraham to stop and not harm the boy. The angel knew that Abraham feared the Lord because he had not withheld his only son. The sacrifice of Isaac put Abraham to his most agonizing test, a trial which he passed completely because of his total faith, love, and obedience to God.       It should also be our aim to obey God every moment of our lives. Every now and then, even while working every day we should pause for prayer to give a thought of love to God and offer ourselves to Him.       What do I need to sacrifice in my own life to follow God more closely?","Enhancing our Faith       The Ten Commandments which God gave to Moses at Mt. Sinai, are His special rules.

We must show that we love God by loving one another. It is easy to love those who are lovable but we must also love those who are difficult to love.  Love must always be present in the way we treat one another.       Our neighbors are those persons next to us no matter who they are. They could be people of a different color, language or culture.

Romans 13: 1 – 5","Knowing our Faith       When Jesus established the Church, He planned that it would last forever. He would need leaders to continue what he had started. He wants his leaders to implement the laws and guide people in following them.       Jesus chose Peter as the first head of the Church. Through the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit, he was able to guide the Church. Peter was an eye witness of Christ’s public life and had spent three years learning from Jesus and working with him.       The other apostles of Jesus collaborated with Peter in leading the people of God and preaching the Good News to all the nations. They were Jesus’ witnesses too because they had seen and heard Jesus teaching, rising the dead, and curing the sick. The apostles were filled with love, strength, joy, and courage in proclaiming the name of Jesus to others. Jesus gave important mission to his Apostles to lead, rule and sanctify. Our bishops and priests of today continue the work of the Apostles in the Church.       The Church has given us reminders to fulfill as its members. We must observe the following precepts or rules of the Church:  1. We must attend Mass on Sundays and holy days of obligations.  2. We must receive the Sacrament of Penance at least once a year.  3. We must humbly receive Holy Communion at least during the Easter      Season.  4. We must contribute alms for the support of the Church.  5. We must observe the prescribed days of fast and abstinence.  6. We must observe the Marriage Law of the Church.","Challenges of our Faith       We must understand that the Church has leaders who make its laws which must be obeyed. As members of the Church, we must keep the church laws by obeying the leaders in the Church.       The Church is the most wonderful family to which we belong. We must love, respect, and obey its rulers. We must also obey the laws of the Church as we obey its rulers.       How do we show our love and respect to our bishop? How do we show our obedience to him? How do we show our love and respect to our priests? How do we show our obedience to our parish priest his associate priests and to the lay ministers who help them?","Enhancing our Faith  Fill in the blanks. ________________ is the source of all authority.

Growing in faith means that we believe that God      loves us. Growing in hope means that we trust God. Growing in love      means that we live everyday at the service of God and others at","home, in school or in the community.","Celebrating our Faith       All good laws come from God. God’s laws are transmitted to us through our parents, teachers, and leaders of the Church and our country. They are especially called by God to guide us in following the rules properly and with joy. When we respect and obey the rules, we also love and obey God.       Let us open our hearts and minds to God as we follow the example of Jesus who is the model of perfect obedience to his Father. We are happy in obeying the precepts of the Church with love and without complain. Let us pray to Mary, the Mother of Jesus, to help us keep and obey the laws of the Church.       Let us now pray: “Hail Holy Queen” and offer it for the intentions of our Church leaders, the pope, bishops, and priests.  To show our love and unity let us recite the prayer that Jesus taught us.

Buildings were destroyed and many inhabitants died because of the massive storm surge. Many roads were impassable and communications were cut off. It was a scene of total devastation. Many survivors lost their loved ones, homes, and many were hungry. During the powerful typhoon Yolanda, there were no rich nor poor. Everybody was affected.","Tacloban City and the whole Philippines was blessed with an influx of material and moral support from other parts of the world and also from all over the country. Nearly one month after the super typhoon Yolanda, generous donations and support for the typhoon victims have still not ceased. Many establishments, schools, and offices have canceled their Christmas party and donated their budget for the Yolanda survivors. Even kindergarten pupils set aside an amount for the victims. Here’s a little reflection of one of the many rescuers:       “At the end of the day, all of us, victims and rescuers alike, may be wounded and scarred in the frontlines where we saw the faces of deaths, devastation, and decay, but we feel very happy that we did our share to appease the anguish of the victims. As we helped them, we have also helped ourselves feel better with what we have done. Perhaps, God allowed that calamity to happen in order to make us become a better Christian, a more responsible Filipino.”(wwwphilstar.com-Postscript to super typhoon Yolanda by Atty. Josephus B.

Some generous rich people in the city share what they have to the Caritas office in the parish. There were those who have just enough but were willing to share the little they have to others. Other people came together in their GKK to offer prayers for all the victims of different calamities. More than anything else, the people cared for one another.       The whole Philippines and other parts of the world were shaken with what happened to Tacloban City. Many people from other islands, regions, and cities of the Philippines and other parts of the world were moved to offer help in any means for the victims of super typhoon Yolanda.       The people of God have taken the words of Jesus about helping those who are sufferings. They know that as followers and friends of Jesus they need to show their love and care for others.

When did we see you a stranger and make you welcome; naked and clothe you; sick or in prison and go to see you?

She said to him; “promise that these two sons of mine may sit one at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom.” You do not know what you are asking, Jesus answered. Can you drink the cup that I am going to drink? They replied, “we can” very well, he said, you shall drink my cup, but as for seats at my right hand and my left, these are not mine to grant; they belong to those to whom they have been allotted by my Father.       When the other ten heard this they were indignant with the two brothers. But Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that among the pagans, the rulers lord it over them, and their great men make their authority felt. This is not to happen among you. No, anyone who wants to be great among you must be your servant, and anyone who wants to be first among you must be your slave, just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.

Therefore, we also show our love to Jesus when we perform the following Spiritual Works of Mercy.  a. Correct the sinners. It is a sign of one’s love and concern when we      correct the mistakes of others politely.  b. Instructing the ignorant.

Every eye in the stadium was with Nadia and the judges. All of Montreal and the entire world were dazzled by the performance of the young gymnast. There was a hush as the score went up. ”Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten!” For the first time in modern Olympic history, a gymnast had gotten a perfect score. The gold medal and the hearts of the world went to Nadia Comaneci.","Nadia was born on November 12, 1961, in Onesti, Romania. Her father was a merchant. Her mother worked at the office. When she was just six years old, Nadia wanted to become a gymnast. So, she attended a program training.       Nadia worked hard to learn the basics. She practiced her skills everyday. Since she wanted to be the best, she never gave up. She had to make many sacrifices to learn everything about gymnastic, but Nadia never gave up. In two years, she was chosen to be in the Junia National Team.       After four years, Nadia was chosen to be a member of the Romanian Olympic Team. In the summer Olympic Games of 1976, Nadia Comaneci won two gold medals, one silver medal, and the title of Women’s World Champion.       The day after she returned to Romania from Canada, Nadia was seen walking to the gym to practice. She knew that even though she had been chosen and had won, she needed to work out every single day.  Value Development       The important point to stress in the story of Nadia is that winning the gold medal or achieving any worthwhile goal takes long hours, days, and even years of practice and perseverance.       Every decision making process in every aspect of our life, produces a final choice. When we decide to make priorities according to our values; the same is true in our Christian life: we sacrifice something we love in order to attain the highest good who is Jesus Christ. In the process, we must learn the basic skills of being a follower of Jesus Christ. Daily practice of the Gospel values and living the lifestyle of Jesus Christ makes us true children of God.","1. What did Nadia do to become a great gymnast?  2. How did she win her two gold medals and one silver medal?  3. What were the steps that she followed?  4. What does that mean to you?  5. How do we become true children of God?   Proclamation of the Word of God         A certain Pharisee named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish  Sanhedrin, came to Jesus by night. “Rabbi,” he said, “we know you  are a teacher come from God, for no one can perform the signs and  wonders such as you perform unless God is with him.” Jesus gave him  this answer:         “I solemnly assure you, no one can see the reign of God unless he  is begotten from above.”         “How can a man be born again once he is old? retorted  Nicodemus. Can he return to his mother’s womb and be born over  again?” Jesus replied:         “I solemnly assure you, no one can enter into God’s kingdom  without being begotten of water and Spirit. Flesh begets flesh, Spirit  begets spirit. Do not be surprised that I tell you, you must all be  begotten from above.                                                                                                              John 3: 1 – 7","The Gospel shows the evidence of the new life Jesus offered His followers. Nicodemus wanted to follow Jesus. He wanted to believe. He wanted to know the truth. Jesus shared with Nicodemus that in God’s Kingdom, people are born again of water and the Holy Spirit.  - Who is Nicodemus? - Why do you think Nicodemus was afraid to meet Jesus in      public? - What was his question to Jesus? - What was the reply of Jesus to Nicodemus’ question? Knowing our Faith       We become members of the Church and children of God through our baptism. Christ instituted Baptism as the sacrament of spiritual rebirth, making the baptized members of God’s family. Baptism infuses grace into our souls, making us supernaturally like God. As children of God we are given the right to enter heaven and to gain merit by our good works (cf Jn. 3:5 - My Catholic faith p. 272).       The sacramental grace of Baptism is a regenerative grace that helps those baptized to live well the supernatural life they have begun as children of God (My Catholic faith p. 272).       Baptism takes away original sin, all personal sins, and all punishment due to sin. It makes the baptized person a participant in the divine life of the Trinity through sanctifying grace…..(My Catholic faith p. 272). We also take part in a new life, to share God’s own life and love.       When we were infants, we were baptized: our parents and godparents said, “Yes” for us. They helped us as we get older to keep on saying “Yes” to God. Now that we are older we can say our “yes” to God willingly and joyfully. God has incorporated us into His family, the Church. We become adopted sons and daughters of God.","In Baptism, we become sharers of the very life of the Blessed Trinity, so that we can truly say that God is our Father and Jesus is our brother. We are brothers and sisters to one another because the Holy Spirit lives and bonds us to each other.  Challenges of our Faith       We must be born again of water and Spirit in order to enter the kingdom of God. We received God’s life and love. We must share this life with other people by telling them about God’s goodness, His gifts, His love, and by the way we act.       Sometimes, there are children being taken cared of by foster parents because their parents died. We can say that the children were adopted by another family. For us, when we received the sacrament of baptism we became adopted children of God and members of His family.        When we are brought into God’s family, we receive a special gift that is the new life with Jesus. We live this life with Him now. Therefore, we must be faithful to our baptismal commitment not only in words but also in action. Let us be attentive during our Christian Living subject and read the Word of God with faith, hope, and love.","Enhancing our Faith  A. Fill in the blanks.       1.

Each of us must show our gratitude to God because through Baptism we received our name and became His children.       We must remember the date of our Baptism, the names of our godparents and the priest who baptized us.  We recall that our parents and godparents made a promise for us.       We are reminded of the things used in our Baptism like: candle, white robe, and the water.  Celebrating our Faith       Let us now pray and thank God for the wonderful gifts we received during our baptism. This is a very special event in our life. We received this Sacrament only once because it imprints in our soul an indelible character which cannot be removed by anything even mortal sin (My Catholic faith p. 273). In the liturgy of the Sacrament of Baptism, our parents and godparents made a promise on our behalf.       We all say this prayer, wherein the leader will say the part of the priest and all of us will answer.  Priest: That this child may live someday with God in heaven.  People: Lord, hear our prayer.  Priest: That this child’s parents and godparents may help him to know,             love, and serve God better.","People: Lord, hear our prayer. Priest: That our family of God may together live in peace and love. People: Lord, hear our prayer. Priest: Do you promise to live as a child of God? People: I do. Priest: Do you promise not to do the work of the devil and all his plans? People: I do. Priest: Do you believe in God the Father? Parents: I do. Priest: Do you believe in God the Son, Jesus Christ? Parents: I do. Priest: Do you believe in God the Holy Spirit? Parents: I do.  Message from Marie Rivier  My dear children,       Christ said, use me for your redemption, do whatever you want with                   me, “I am yours.”","Lesson We Become Faithful Christians   18  Expected Outcomes: a. To tell that sacrament of Confirmation makes us faithful b. To encourage other people to be always ready to help others in need c. To pray and ask God to make us faithful soldiers of Christ  Life Situation                                      Always Ready to Help      There was a rich man who lived in a big house on the side of the beautiful lake. He was a good man and was very generous to his neighbors living in their Barangay. He became a leader of his fellow citizens. Later on, he was elected by the people as the Barangay Captain of their place.","As the year went by, the rich man wondered why the people relied on him too much for all their needs. The people seemed to be lazy, they don’t know how to work on their own in order to save money for their living. They became too dependent on whatever the rich man will give them.       One morning, the rich man went out driving his car in the highway. He placed a big rock at the middle of the road and place some canned goods and bags of rice behind the big rock. He wanted to test the people if anyone would volunteer to remove the big rock at the middle of the road. This scheme was not known to the people.       Few hours later, many people passed by the highway but no one saw and dared to move or remove the rock. Only the poor man saw the big rock at the middle of the road. He ran and removed the big rock for the safety of all who will pass that way. While the poor man was trying to roll the rock to the side of the road, he found the big bag full of foods which he needed for his family. He thanked God for answering his prayer. He also thanked the generous Barangay Captain after knowing that it was he who purposely placed the bag of food.  Value Development  - How would you describe the Barangay Captain?  - How did the Barangay Captain test his people?  - Who among the passersby saw and removed the rock?  - How would you describe the poor man?       We become good and faithful Christians by living the examples of Jesus Christ, our brother. Jesus Christ sends us persons to let us learn the Gospel values through their examples.","Do you know who these persons are? They are your parents, teachers, leaders of your community, and leaders of the Church. They unselfishly gave their help to you and other people.  - Why do you think they give up their unselfish love for people like you      and people who are in need?  - Do you know other people or someone special to you who helped      you grow in God’s love   Proclamation of the Word of God         Then, a teacher of the law came and began putting Jesus to the  test. And he said, “Master, what shall I do to receive eternal life?” Jesus  replied, “What is written in the Scripture? How do you understand it?  The man answered, “It is written, You shall love the Lord your God with  all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your  mind. And you shall love your neighbor as yourself.” Jesus replied, what  a good answer! Do this and you shall live?” The man wanted to keep  up appearances, so he, replied, who is my neighbor?         Jesus then said, “There was a man going down from Jerusalem to  Jericho, and he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him half  dead.         It happened that a priest was going along that road, and saw the  man, but passed by in the other side.         Likewise a Levite saw the man and passed by the other side. But a  Samaritan too was going along that road and, as he came upon the  man, was moved with","compassion. He wants over to him and treated his wounds with oil  and wine and wrapped them with bandages. Then, he put him on his  own animal and brought him to an inn where he took care of him.         The next day, he had to set off, but he gave two silver coins to the  innkeeper and told him. Take care of him and whatever you spend on  him, I will repay when I come back.”         Jesus then asked, “Which of these three do you think made himself  neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?”                                                                                           Luke 10: 25 – 36  Knowing our Faith       Confirmation is one of the seven sacraments of the Church. It is the sacrament through which the Holy Spirit comes to us in a special way and enables us to profess our faith as strong and perfect Christians and soldiers of Jesus Christ (My Catholic faith p. 278). It is one of the sacraments of initiation.       Confirmation creates within us a spirit of meekness. It increases our love of God and neighbor. It enlightens our understanding, strengthens our will, preserves our soul from sin, and inclines our heart to virtue. The sacramental grace of Confirmation helps us to live our faith loyally and to profess it courageously (My Catholic faith p. 279).","Jesus was then asked: “Who is my neighbor?” He answered the question through a story. The story of the Good Samaritan which shows how we must be witnesses to Christ’s love by helping, taking care and showing concern for those in need.       As faithful Christians, we must be aware of the needs of our neighbors. The Holy Spirit will help us and give us strength to take care of those people, especially; the poor who need our love and care.       Jesus wanted to tell us how very important it was to Him that we love one another. He said, “Whatever you do to the least of my brothers and sisters, you do unto me.”       Most of us do not have the opportunity to help people who are robbed. There are times when we can be “Good Samaritans.” We can do it by showing our love and concern for the needy: at home and in our neighborhood. Helping others is not selective. It goes beyond, race, religion, and culture.  Challenges of our Faith       To love and to care is part and parcel of being Christians. When we become more aware of how we are cared for by others, then, we begin to see the importance of love and care in human relationships. Since we were small, our lives depended on how we were taken cared of by other people. Our safety, health, and well-being depend on people who care for us.       Sometimes, we don’t want to take care of others. We are afraid especially when we are not sure of what we are doing or if we do not know the person. That is why, we always depend on the help of the Holy Spirit to strengthen our hearts and mind.       Let us ask the Holy Spirit to strengthen our faith and make us strong to help others whoever they are. When somebody helps or takes care of us we should always say, “Thank you”.","On Sundays, during the Holy Mass, we have a special chance to extend our help. We can offer our Mass for the needs of others. We can also contribute an amount during the collection for the support of our Parish Church. There are many people in our parish who needs our help too. We should not hesitate to extend our service anytime we are needed.       To live our commitment as faithful Christians is not easy. However, with the help of the Holy Spirit who make us strong and courageous, let us not be afraid to express our faith not only in words but also in our deeds. As soldiers of Christ, let us keep our faith burning by loving our neighbors especially those in need.  Enhancing our Faith  Show in your drawing that you helped someone in need.                   At home with father mother and elders","In school with teacher and classmates                    In your GKK","Living our Faith       When we go home we will always be ready to help our parents, brothers, and sisters. We will do something special by sharing our helping hands to those in need anytime and anywhere.       We show that we are faithful Christians when we say “I love you”, “Thank you” or “You are special” to someone at home, in school, and in our community.  Celebrating our Faith       One of the many ways by which we can show our love for others is to pray for them.  Let us form a circle and say our prayer together.       “Holy Spirit, help us to be good and faithful Christians. Touch our hearts to be always ready to help our neighbors in need; to poor people we meet on the way, to someone who needs shelter, clothing, and food. We also pray for those who are looking for job to support their family. Direct them, O Holy Spirit, to find one.”  Let us sing together:  We are happy Christians united in the Lord, we belong to one family. Jesus Christ has chosen us to carry on his life, over every land and sea. From the North and from the South and from the East and West, He has called all together.","And we are delighted that we are united into God’s own family. And we are delighted that we are united into God’s own family. Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit,       As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be world without end. Amen.  Message from Marie Rivier  My dear children,                             Oh, how I wish that the world be converted and that                       we carry the fire of God’s love and the knowledge of                       Jesus Christ everywhere.","Lesson                 19                  We Ask for Forgiveness  Expected Outcomes: a. To realize the need of God’s forgiveness by receiving the sacrament       of reconciliation b. To express that we are ready to reconcile and work for peace in       God’s family c. To pray to ask God’s forgiveness for sins committed  Life Situation                                         Choose to Forgive      Norma and Eunice were studying in Bago Elementary School. They belong to Grade Four Class A. They usually meet in the terminal for a ride to go the school. As months passed by, they became friends. They were  of the same age and enjoyed sharing their likes and dislikes. Later on, they discovered that they were cousins. They also shared about their families and relatives. They got many friends because they were both talented and honor pupils.","One day, Norma and Eunice had a little misunderstanding which led them to avoid each other. One Saturday afternoon, Norma invited her classmates and friends in their house for a party. She did not invite Eunice because they were not reconciled yet. They did not talk to each other for almost one week. Their parents were also surprised why the two cousins were in cold war. But later on, Norma realized her mistakes. She took the initiative to talk to Eunice. Norma was jealous with Eunice because she got the first honor while Norma got the second honor. Eunice willingly forgave Norma and they became friends again.  Value Development       Sometimes we are hurt by what others say about us. As human beings, we know what is right and what is wrong. We have the conscience, intellect, and freedom to choose to forgive.        There are times in our lives when we follow our human desires which are in contrast with what God wants. Because of our sinful nature, we can be easily tempted to quarrel with others or to make foolishness that hurt the feelings of others.       Like the story of Norma and Eunice, whose story is an example for us to learn the bad effects of jealousy and lack of communication. We are reminded in the Gospel that we should not let the sunset come without being reconciled. Asking forgiveness and to be forgiven is the work of God. Therefore, let us always remember to ask God’s help in moments when we have a hard time to ask for forgiveness and to forgive others.","- What can you say about Norma and Eunice? - What was the cause of their misunderstanding? - How did Norma and Eunice reconcile? - Have you also experienced being jealous with other’s       accomplishment? - What did you do to be reconciled and be friends again?       Yes, it is true that we need someone to guide us as we continue our journey and live a joyful and happy life.       God is so good that He gave us a special friend who is the source of love and who teaches us to forgive one another.   Proclamation of the Word of God         Then, Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, if my brother keeps  on sinning against me, how many times do I have to forgive him?  Seven times?         “No not seven times”, Jesus answered, but seventy times seven  times” because the kingdom of heaven is like this. Once there was a  king who decided to check on his servants’ accounts. He had just  begun to do so when one of them was brought in who owed him  millions of pounds. The servant did not have enough to pay his debt,  so the king ordered him to be sold as a slave, with his wife, his children,  and all that he had in order to pay the debt. The servant fell on his  knees before the king. ‘Be patient with me,’ he begged, ‘and I will pay  you everything!’ The king felt sorry for him, so he forgave him the debt  and let him go.","Then the man went out and met one of his fellow-servants who  owed him a few pounds. He grabbed him and started choking him.  ‘Pay back what you owe me!’ he said. His fellow-servant fell down  and begged him, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay you back!’ But he  refused; instead, he had him thrown into jail until he should pay the  debt. When the other servants saw what had happened, they were  upset and went to the king and told him everything. So he called the  servant in ‘You worthless slave’ he said. ‘I forgave you the whole  amount you owed me, just because you asked me to. You should  have had mercy on your fellow-servant, just as I had mercy on you.’  The king was very angry and he sent the servant to jail to be punished  until he should pay back the whole amount.         And Jesus concluded, “That is how my Father in heaven will treat  every one of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart. “                                                                                                   Matthew 18: 21 – 35  Knowing our Faith       In the Gospel, Jesus emphasizes the importance of forgiving people and being forgiven for wrong choices. If everyone has a good habit of forgiving and giving forgiveness to others, there will surely be peace on earth. We can live closer to God and to one another.","Jesus, through the Church gave a very special gift to His followers. He said to His apostles, “I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; what you prohibit on earth will be prohibited in heaven, and what you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven”(Mt. 16:19). The gift Jesus gave is the Sacrament of Reconciliation.  This Sacrament of Reconciliation is sometimes called.  Forgiveness.  A sinful person is alienated from the church and               community. Once he/she is forgiven by God through the               priest he/she is brought back to the Church and to the               community.  Confession.   As a sinful person, he/she has to confess or tell his/her sins               to the priest in order to be forgiven.  Penance.      The priest prays and gives penance to the sorrowful               person. The penance helps a person make up for her/his               sins.  Reconciliation. Through this sacrament the sinful person is forgiven and                        being reconciled with God. The word - reconcile means                        “to bring together again.”  There are five steps in the sacrament of Reconciliation:  1. Examination of conscience.  2. Be sorry for our sins.  3. Have a firm purpose of not sinning again.  4. Confess our sins to the priest.  5. Be willing to perform the penance the priest gives us.","Challenges of our Faith       Love is necessary to be a member in the Mystical Body of Christ. It is the mark for judgment and it is the mission of every Christian. Many young people like us are eager to express our belongingness to any organization like family, school, club or church. It is important that we learn how to express belongingness to God’s family through our participation in the sacramental life, by following and participating in the sacraments, and forgiving one another.       Sometimes, we find it difficult to ask for forgiveness or to forgive others. When we hurt people we love, we feel sad and lonely. Sometimes, we are not ready to be reconciled with our best friend because of pride. We do not want to hold grudges but when words are spoken like “I forgive you or I am sorry,” there is joy and peace again in our relationship with one another.       God calls us to forgive one another. Being forgiven and has given of forgiveness is as a sign of love for God. We must be humble enough to accept our failures and forgive the failures of others, too. When we are sorry, let us be careful and learn from our experiences and keep our relationship with trust for one another.  Enhancing our Faith       Let us review how to go to confession. The following outline will help you remember how to celebrate the Sacrament of Reconciliation as you confess your sins to a priest.  1. As you enter the confessional box, the priest greets you and makes      the sign of the cross. “In the name of the __________, and of      the_________, and of the ________________. Amen.  2. The priest then says a short prayer. At the end of the prayer you      answer, “_______________”","3. You confess your sins to the priest. He will talk to you and give you      advice how to become a better Christian. So, you must      ________________ to the priest.  4. The priest gives you a _____________.  5. God through the priest ____________________ your sins.  6. The priest says, “Go in ______________________.”  7. You will answer, “_______________________, Father.”  Living our Faith       We help the members of our family to express both the need for forgiveness and to forgive another person.  Activity:  Divide the class with 5 to 6 members in each groups.       Let us try to make a “Forgiveness Banner.” Provide your own materials. On the banner, you may draw or put pictures as symbols of the five things that we have to do as we receive the sacrament of forgiveness.  1. Examination of conscience.  2. Be sorry for your sins.  3. Tell your sins to the priest.  4. Pray your penance.  5. Promise to change.       Let us share these reminders to our parents at home, to our classmates in school, and to other people of God in the community.","Celebrating our Faith       Before going to confession let us have a short presentation on how to ask for the gift of forgiveness or celebrate the Sacrament of Reconciliation.  1. Form a circle and have a lighted candle. 2. Let us say this prayer together.       Father, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart. In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good, I have sinned against you. I know I should love you above all things. With your help, I will not sin again. I will stay away from things that help me make wrong choices. Jesus Christ, your Son suffered and died for me. In his name dear Father, forgive me. Amen.  3. Let’s say together - Our Father in heaven. . . 4. When we say “Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sinned us .       . . go around and give your lighted candle to those whom you hurt or      those who have hurt you. 5. Let us offer each other a sign of PEACE. 6. Closing Hymn: I forgive you, I love you, You are mine take my hand,      go in peace, sinned no more beloved one.  Message from Marie Rivier  My dear children,  Christ Jesus gave himself to us with an overflowing love.","Lesson The Eucharist Unites Us in Christ   20  Expected Outcomes: a. To tell that Jesus is calling us to be one b. To show that we are ready to be united as children of God c. To pray asking Jesus to help us bring peace and unity to others  Life Situation                                              We Are One      Mr. Felimon, Band Master of the Pamas Elementary School was requested by the school principal to prepare a Rhythm band to be presented during their School Foundation Day. The Grade Four – Saint Cecilia class was chosen to participate. Almost all the pupils from this  section were very good in playing the different musical instruments. Five pupils were assigned to play the tambourines, another five pupils played the maracas, five pupils played the tik-tak made of bamboo sticks, five pupils played the guitar, another five pupils played the violin and another group of five pupils played the banjolina. Rhona was selected as the lead organist with Corazon who played his clarinet.","Many visitors came to witness the musical rendition. To start the evening program, the Rhythm band played the marching music as the people gathered in the school campus. Teachers and parents of the pupils were amazed looking at their children’s performance.       Before the program ended, Mr. Arenas, the master of ceremony, gave a special recognition to the talented pupils who made the foundation day celebration successful through their band presentation.       The school principal invited everyone to join him, in the spirit of thanksgiving to God for the wonderful presentation of the Grade Four pupils. He also thanked everyone for what their contribution to the success of their Annual Foundation Day Celebration.  Value Development       We are happy as children of God who are called to be one to bring peace and unity to everyone. We are proud to share our talents that we received from God.  - Have you ever watched a Rhythm Band perform?  - What can you say about the performance of the different pupils with      their own musical instruments?  - How did Mr. Felimon organize a Rhythm Band in their school?  - How did he manage to prepare the selected pupils to participate      well in their presentation?  - Was the Rhythm Band successfully presented?  - What happens if one group did not perform well? How do you feel      about it?  - If you are in the place of the pupils, what will you do everyday to      make your performance a success?  - What do you think is the most important celebration that God wants      us to celebrate and gather together as God’s family?       Let us learn to discover our talents and be willing to share to others in order to create the spirit of unity in Christ’s community.","Proclamation of the Word of God         Each of us has received a special gift in proportion to what Christ  has given.         It was He who gave gifts; He appointed some to be apostles, others  to be prophets, others to be evangelists, and others to be pastors and  teachers. He did this to prepare God’s people for the work of Christian  service, in order to build up the body of Christ. And so we shall come  together to that oneness in our faith and in our knowledge to the Son  of God; we shall become mature people, reaching to the very height  of Christ’s full stature.                                                                                                   Ephesians 4:7; 11-13         Is not the cup of blessing we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ?  Because the loaf of bread is one, we, many though we are, are one  body, for we all partake of the one loaf.                                                                                             1 Corinthians 10: 16 – 17         This communion through the body and blood of the Risen Christ  and our personal encounter with Christ make all of us one body. We  form one body. This does not only mean that we feel united but that  the Risen Christ unites us to himself and in so doing, gives the  community new strength. Message for us to remember:       Let us remind ourselves and our family members that when we receive Jesus in Holy Communion we are close to him as we see Him in the appearance of bread and wine. He gives us strength to carry out our duties as Christians. We are united with him for he forgives our sins, reconciles us with one another, and helps us build our Christian community, the Church.","Knowing our Faith       The Holy Eucharist is the greatest sacrifice we can offer to God. It is a sacrament and a sacrifice in which our Lord Jesus Christ, body and blood, soul and divinity is contained, offered, and received under the appearances of bread and wine. (My Catholic Faith pg. 280). It was because of God’s great love for us that He sent His only Son to be our sacrifice. We renew this sacrifice on the altar in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass everyday. We celebrate the entire Paschal Mystery of Jesus; His passion, death, and resurrection.       The word Eucharist means Thanksgiving because when Christ instituted it, He gave thanks. Today, it is the chief means by which we give thanks to God (My Catholic Faith pg. 280).       After the Last Supper before He died, Christ instituted the Holy Eucharist. In the presence of His apostles, He changed the bread and wine into His Body and Blood. This process is called transubstantiation. He also commanded His apostles to continue celebrating this sacrifice when He said, “Do this in remembrance of me.” They realized that Jesus wanted them to continue His sacrifice and to keep on renewing the New Covenant between God and man. That is why, all Catholics go to Church on Sundays to celebrate the Eucharist together.       The Holy Eucharist is the covenant meal, the sacred banquet, to which Jesus invites us to participate. Jesus gives Himself to us in a form of bread in the Holy Communion to nourish us spiritually. His life grows in us and we become more like Him. The Eucharistic celebration brings us together as a community in Christ in whom we have “received the means for giving worthy worship to God” (CFC #1680). The more we received Him the more we should grow in our love for our brothers and sisters as God’s family. That’s why, we come to realize that the Holy Eucharist unites us with Christ and with one another.","Challenges of our Faith       What can we do with our God-given talents? Each one of us who makes up the Christian community has been given by God the different talents to be shared with one another in our community. When you are good in singing, be the psalmist during the Holy Mass. If you are good in reading, be a lector in your parish church. If you are gifted in playing the organ or guitar, do it with joy. It is during the celebration of the Holy Eucharist that we experience togetherness, unity, and peace with Jesus who is the sacrifice and the main celebrant.       However, there are times when we failed to share our talents with others. Perhaps, we have not discovered them yet or we are shy to express ourselves. Yet, God had given us such talents to be used for the growth of the Kingdom of God. Whatever talents we have, a preacher, a teacher, a young evangelizer, an ordinary layman, or woman in the Church, we are all precious in the eyes of God. If you want to grow in your Christian life, do not keep your talents to yourself, share them with others.","Enhancing our Faith  A. How can our talents unite the community?      Illustrate your answer inside the box.  B. Describe some acts that promote unity.      1. At home :      2. In school :      3. In community :","We learn to share our gifts or talents that we received from God to others. When we serve one another, we show unity. This is a living sign of being a Eucharist to others. Through this way, we proclaim Christ’s presence not only in our words but also in our actions.       One way of sharing our gifts is to do our assignment at home faithfully. We help our mother in the kitchen. We wash dishes after we finish our meals without being told.       In school, we help to maintain peace and unity, by listening attentively to our teachers or to our classmates during recitation. We help clean our classroom and arrange the chairs properly. We should not be shy to volunteer to help whenever the need arises.       We lead to segregate our garbage and throw it in the designated trash cans in order to keep our campus clean.       When we attend the prayer meeting in our GKK we participate actively during the “Kasaulogan sa Pulong.” We try to volunteer to prepare the chapel by arranging flowers in the altar before the celebration starts. We also help maintain cleanliness in the surroundings of our little chapel.  Celebrating our Faith       Let us raise our voices in praising and thanking God for giving us talents to serve one another in our Christian community.  Let us pray together:       Loving Father, we praise and thank you for all the gifts and talents you gave us. Through these talents, we make others happy especially our own family, our school family, and our Christian family. How good it is and how lovely it will be to live as one God’s family! We ask this in the name of Jesus our friend and brother. Amen.","Let us sing together: We Are One In The Spirit  1. We are one in the Spirit, we are one in the Lord.      We are one in the Spirit, we are one in the Lord.      And we pray that all unity may one day be restored.       Ref. And they’ll know we are Christians by our love.      Yes, they’ll know we are Christians by our love.  2. We will walk with each other, we will walk hand in hand.      We will walk with each other, we will walk hand in hand.      And together we’ll spread the news that God is in our land. ( Ref.)  Message from Marie Rivier  My dear children,                             Do not think you have to go to the ends of the earth                       to find Christ Jesus; He is the nourishment of our souls.","Lesson                 21                We Pray for Those in Need  Expected Outcomes: a. To realize the need of God’s forgiveness by receiving the sacrament       of reconciliation b. To express that we are ready to reconcile and work for peace in       God’s family c. To pray to ask God’s forgiveness for sins committed  Life Situation                                     Give Care and Concern      Michael and Micah finished breakfast quickly. They started running out of their door. “Not so fast” called their mother. “You have to help me clean the house.” She said to both of them. “You can  start scrubbing the floor Michael.” “Oh, mother, I have to visit Hilda right away, she is sick” said Michael. “Not until you finish your work,” answered her mother. “No, mother, we want to visit Hilda first, then, we come back and do our work” chorused Michael and Micah. However, they followed their mother’s request. After they finished their work at home, Michael and Micah went to visit Hilda with permission from their mother. It was only five minutes’ walk to get to Hilda’s house.","Michael did not say anything but he thought of calling their parish priest through the phone, asking favor to visit Hilda who was suffering from her illness. Then, the priest came to pray over for Hilda and gave her the Sacrament of the Anointing of the sick.       When Michael and Micah arrived home, they told their mother about the health condition of Hilda. The mother told them, “I was so happy that you visited Hilda, your friend, because she needed your help and most especially for asking our Parish Priest to give her the sacrament of healing.”       After five days, Michael and Micah visited Hilda again. They were very happy to see Hilda feeling better. The parents of Hilda were also very happy and grateful to Michael and Micah for their love and concern for their friend, Hilda.","Value Development       There are many ways of reaching out and remembering people who are in need of our help.  - What was the health condition of Hilda? - What were some signs of care and concern that Micah and Michael       showed to their friend, Hilda? - What did their mother say to Michael and Micah? - What happened to Hilda after five days? - What was the reaction of the parents of Hilda after she got better?       When Michael and Micah visited Hilda, they prayed for her and asked God for healing. They believed that God loves her and they trusted that God will answer their prayer. They told Hilda about the healing power of Jesus. They shared with her the many healing incidents performed by Jesus in the Gospel.       Do you agree with what Michael and Micah did for Hilda?  Activity:  In times of sickness, do you feel abandoned by God? Explain and write your answer below.","","Proclamation of the Word of God       Jesus was in a certain place praying and when He had finished one of His disciples said, “Lord, teach us to pray,” just as John taught his disciples. He said to them, “say this when you pray,               Father, may your name be held holy,              Your kingdom come;              Give us each day our daily bread,              And forgive us our sins;              For we forgive each one who is in debt to us,              And do not put us to the test.”       He also said to them, suppose one of you has a friend and goes to him in the middle of the night to say “my friend, lend me three loaves, because a friend of mine on his travels has just arrived at my house and I have nothing to offer him.” And the man answers from inside the house, “Do not bother me, the door is bolted now and my children and I are in bed. I cannot get up to give it to you.” I tell you, if the man does not get up and give it to him for friendship’s sake, persistence will be enough to make him get up and give his friend all he wants.       So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; search and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For the one who asks always receives; the one who searches always finds; the one who knocks will always have the door opened to him. What father among you would hand his son a stone when he asked for bread? Or hand him a snake instead of a fish? Or hand him a scorpion if he asked for an egg? If you then, who are evil, know how to give your children what is good, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?                                                                                                          Luke 11: 1 -12","Knowing our Faith       Jesus taught us this Christian prayer for which there is no substitute, the “Our Father”, on the day on which one of His disciples saw Him praying and asked Him, “Lord teach us to pray,” The Our Father is the “summary of the whole Gospel”, the “perfect prayer” (Compendium - CCC  #578-579)       In the “Our Father” we do not only pray in the name of Jesus, but in His own words. In saying the “Our Father” we offer ourselves entirely to God and ask from Him the best things, not only for ourselves, but also for our neighbors. No prayer means so much in so few words. The “Our Father” contains petitions for all the needs of soul and body. It is at the same time a prayer of praise, petition, and contrition. (My Catholic Faith pg.  398)       Praying the “Our Father” involves acts of faith, hope, and charity. We need faith to profess God as our Father despite His silence, and apparent remoteness that we will be spared from all the evil and suffering surrounding us. We express our hope that His Kingdom already inaugurated by Christ His Son may come to fulfillment and that His will be done, forever. Finally, we find all warmth and intimacy of love in God our Father, experienced in His Spirit. (CFC # 2132)  Challenges of our Faith       Jesus wants us to learn this beautiful prayer. Jesus wants us to remember that His Father is our Father, too. He also wants us to remember that we are all brothers and sisters in the one big family of God, so we say “Our” instead of “My”. Jesus wants us to praise God, Our Father. He is like our own father who also wants to be praised.       There are ways of showing that we praise our own father. One of the ways is shown in the story.","One day, little Junoy overheard a conversation between two men. He realized that they were talking about his father. How pleased he was when he heard one saying, “Mr. Canoy is a good fellow. He is always ready to help anyone no matter how busy or tired he is.” “Well, if he says a thing to happen and if he promises to do anything, he’ll do it.” said the other man. Junoy was so happy and excited that he couldn’t help but turn around and say proudly, “He is my father.”       All of us like to hear those we love being praised by other people. In the same way, Jesus wants His Father to be praised too. Let us often praised Him and try to get others to praise Him, too. Sometimes, at home in the kitchen, when mother is cooking and it smells good, talk to God about it and tell him how good He is. God has planned such wonderful things for us that we could never stop praising Him.  Enhancing our Faith  A. Simple recall: Fill in the blanks.       1.

Draw a picture of the things you ask from God and which you feel will      be answered by God.","Living our Faith       There are still many people around us who consider God as a seasonal God. This means, they only pray to God when they need Him. Most of the time, they are busy doing their work but they forget to pray to the author of their work. How many of these people do we know? They need our prayer. Every time we say “Your Kingdom Come,” we are praying that many people will learn to know and love God.       We can tell others how much God loves them through our example. We can practice what the “Our Father” asked of us: at home – by forgiving our brother who got our ball pen without permission; by saying sorry to our mother or father when we commit mistakes. At school – by acknowledging our faults, by saying thank you or excuse me.       Praying the “Our Father” by heart and practicing it daily is a ticket for heaven. When we obey our parents, we are doing God’s will. At school, when we do what our teachers will tell us, we are also doing God’s will.  Celebrating our Faith       Let us now form a circle and pray together the beautiful prayer that Jesus taught us like what He did to his apostles.       With open hands and heart, let us praise and thank God by praying the Lord’s Prayer.            “Our Father in heaven, holy be Your Name, Your kingdom come,      Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily      bread and forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sinned against      us. Do not bring us to the test but deliver us from evil, Amen.”","Jesus teaches us that when we pray to God we do not think only of ourselves but others too.  Let us say the litany of praise:       For our parents. We praise You, God.      For our daily food. We praise You, God.      For this beautiful world we live in. We praise You, God.      For all the people around us. We praise You, God.

He finished his studies being a working student at the canteen for his daily sustenance. His uncle, who is an engineer, working abroad, supported his schooling.","After many years, Danilo became a good and successful engineer who worked in the government road construction. Many were amazed upon knowing how Danilo became a professional engineer in spite of being poor.  Value Development       Every time we see beautiful things around us like buildings or paintings and many more, we always remember those people who made them. There were those who come from a poor family who become well-known engineers or architects. They were blessed by God because they helped themselves and became what they are now.

Though, we are still in grade four, we can still do marvelous things in a marvelous way. Everything in this world is for us to care and develop.

Be strong and show yourself as a man. Keep the commandments of Yahweh your God and walk in his ways. Keep his commands, his ordinances and declarations written in the Law of Moses, that you may succeed in whatever you do and wherever you go. If you do so, Yahweh will fulfill the promise he made to me, “If your sons take care to walk before me faithfully with their whole heart and their whole soul, you shall always have one of your descendants on the throne of Israel.”       God gave Solomon great wisdom, understanding, and knowledge as vast as the sand on the shore, so that his wisdom surpassed that of all the people of the East and of the Egyptians.       In the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, he built the temple of Yahweh. Then, Solomon stood before the altar in the presence of the assembly of Israel. He raised his hands towards heaven and said, “O God of Israel, there is no God like you. You keep your covenant and show loving kindness to your servants who walk before you wholeheartedly. You have foretold this day to your servant David, my father, and this day you have fulfilled your promise. Now, God of Israel, keep this other promise you made to David when you said, “You shall always have someone from your family on the throne of Israel, provided that your sons are careful to serve me as you have done.” Now, therefore, O God of Israel, confirm the promise you have given to David my father. Listen to the prayer of your servant. Watch over this House of which you have said, “My name shall rest there, hear the prayer of your servant in this place.”                                                                                                    1 King 2:1-4;3: 1-9","Knowing our Faith       As Marie Rivier recalls her dreams of a village, where she can teach and preach, her heart was filled with joy and compassion. When she begins to see Thueyts she felt as though she was being sent forth by an irresistible force and her soul was filled with the sweetest joy.       The impulses of one’s heart are also messages from God for those who know how to listen to them. For Marie Rivier, she always listens to God in prayer. She is sure of this. The family of the boarders was happy about the formation received by their daughters as boarders in Marie Rivier’s boarding school in Montpezat. Whenever they came home, the daughters displayed such fine qualities with dignity and simplicity. So they wished that Marie Rivier will open a school in Thueyts. However, there was opposition from other families for they want a couple to run the school. At this point, Marie Rivier continues to pray and wait, hoping that God’s Will be revealed to her soon.       Later, without the knowledge of Marie Rivier, and the family of the boarders, the oppositionist families, have agreed to let her open a school in Thueyts. They provided her with school and a house and even with oil and wheat.       One day Louis Nored went to Montpezat bringing a message from Msgr. Pontanier for Marie Rivier, which says, “In the name of Christ Jesus, my dear daughter, come to Thueyts, for such is God’s Will. This message confirmed her wish and prayer.       Leaping with joy, she left immediately for Thueyts riding in a donkey. As she traveled, she sees only crosses, thousands of them; but these did not disturb her joy. She understood that this imaginary vision would mean that many trials awaited her in Thueyts.","Challenges of our Faith       Everything in this world leads us to Jesus Christ and through Him, to the Father. Like, when David was about to die, he gave his son Solomon an instruction to become strong and show himself as a man. He also told his son to keep the commandments of God and follow the ordinances and declarations written in the Law of Moses wherever he would go.       In the life of Marie Rivier, she experienced many trials along the way. She wanted to open a school in Thueyts but there was opposition from other families who do not believe in her capacity. But Marie Rivier never lost hope and continued to pray for God’s will to be revealed soon. Without the knowledge of Marie Rivier, her prayers were answered when the oppositionists agreed to let her open a school in Thueyts.       Today, we will also experience many trials in our journey. It might be that we will not have “baon” due to financial constraint at home. Our mother cannot buy what we need in the school. Or sometimes, we find it difficult to love a classmate who is a bully. Pray to Jesus and tell everything that bothers you. Jesus knows all these. He is one with us and He understands what we feel. He prays to the Father for us.  Enhancing our Faith  Journal Writing:  A.
